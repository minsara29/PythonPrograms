yes/no,B00002SANH,12-Jun-14,1402556400,One of the reviewers mentioned having prostitutes at the end of the game. I am looking to buy this for my grandchildren. Are there prostitutes?,Y,"I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the 'Sacramento Trail'. Maybe he meant 'prospectors'. I think it's a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on ""Windows 95"" in my youth but it works with my ""Windows XP"" laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won't run it. You could try stuff like 'Doss Box' but that is a route that you probably don't want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it's not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, ""Oregon Trail 2"" is the best version of the ""Oregon Trail"" series."

Do new discs need to be inserted to go on in the game?,,"There is just one disc, so no need to change anything during the game. It worked fine with my Windows 7 laptop. I just got a new Windows 8 laptop -- haven't tried it on that yet."
open-ended,B00002SANH,20-Aug-14,1408518000,This game will not install because I have a 64 bit processor and this game is for a 32 bit processor only. How can I install this game on my computer?,,You can't. This program is for much older computer and won't install on newer models. I had the same issue.
yes/no,B00002SANH,26-Feb-15,1424937600,will this work on newer computer like 8.1?,?,"No it won't, not out of the box. There is a work around that you can look up online though, after that it runs fine. I've done the modification myself and it works with my windows 8.1 64bit laptop."
open-ended,B00002SANH,2-Feb-15,1422864000,does it read to the player or does the player have to do reading on each page to understand what to do next? My child is not proficient enough to read,,I think if you click a button it will read to you but I'm not 100% sure

yes/no,B00002SANH,11-Aug-13,1376204400,"I have Windows 8, will this work on my computer?",?,"Normally no, but there is a work around that I found just by Googling for solutions. I can now play it on Windows 8, but I have to go into the file folder and click on a particular icon. It will then play in a smaller window. It does not fill up the entire screen. Otherwise it works."
yes/no,B00002SANH,11-Aug-13,1376204400,I have Windows 8 on my computer. will this work?,?,Windows 8 I'm not sure I have 7 & it wouldn't work i luckily have a laptop that has XP on it so that's how I found out it worked on XP
yes/no,B000035Y6D,8-Dec-14,1418025600,Does it come in the original box?,?,No. And the console didn't work. I used the cords that came to hook up to a previous console I already had.

open-ended,B000035Y6D,18-Dec-14,1418889600,Hello. What come with this??????????????,,It all depends on who you're buying it from. Read the seller's description to find out what items are included.
yes/no,B000035Y6D,12-Jun-14,1402556400,Does this include the original box?,?,"Only if the seller you select advertises it as 'includes original box'. Most are fairly specific saying 'console only 'or 'console and power, no video cable', etc. If you want the box, check the 'collectible' section of resellers."

They're a bit small and certainly take some getting used to but they're accurate and work very well once you get them setup properly within the game. I use them for roll and use the xml route to set bindings which is a bit more complex than the in-game interface but it's more fully featured. 1 to 10, I'd give them a 6 or 7. There is much much better, but not for around a hundred bucks. Saitek's pedals are good too but they don't integrate with CH software which is one huge bonus for the whole CH line of gear.

He believes that it is compatible with xplane and looked it up and could find nothing that said it was NOT compatible.

By working with it more I hope to improve it, maybe. I have an HP Pavilion i5 with 8 megs of RAM but maybe not the graphics that I need with some of the newer sims. I have an old PII with man sims running on it with a total CH set up, Flightstick Pro, Throttle Pro and CH Rudders with par. ports. With some real aircraft experience, I'll have to say that the old sims were the most realistic, even though they lacked in graphics. Also, you may have a later version than XPlane 10. I have read that '10' did have some control problems. Otherwise, the Flightstick Pro seems to work well with MS Flightsim X and some others I have. CH is a very good company. I've even toured their plant some years ago."

They are incredibly over-sensitive on mine (with Gold X),?,"I have not encountered this problem before, but, if you enter the joystick calibration program from inside the Gold X program, you should be able to determine if the stick is operating properly by watching the response on the calibration screen. I do recall that years ago I had some issues with Microsoft CFS2 with loss of control of aircraft in the program, but, that was due to program errors and settings. If Gold X has difficulty settings, you might check those and see if they are set properly. Good luck."

yes/no,B00006B84W,6-Mar-15,1425628800,Can the left wheel trim be used as a throttle?,Y,"Yes. I used it like that until I bought a separate throttle. You'll want to be sure and make sure the throttle wheel is calibrated each time you fire up the machine because mine jumps around a bit, or build dead zone in the axis extremes to reduce throttle sensitivities in those areas."

open-ended,B00006B84W,6-May-14,1399359600,whats the differ in fighter and combat stick?,,"There's some conflicts in these answers, so let me straighten things up. The Fighter replaces two push buttons with one 4-way hat and one 2-way hat. Other than that the Combat and Fighter stick are identical. They both have a throttle wheel left of the stick, and built in trim wheels for the x and y axes. Trim is a bit troubling on most sticks since you don't get the feedback on the controls as less stick pressure is required. Don't think that this makes this stick bad since any sim that has trim has this drawback unless you have a force-feedback stick that simulates this (those are almost impossible to find.) The extra hats are great for modern jet study sims, but if you are into games like IL-2, there are normally enough buttons. On the otherhand you can map a ton of functions to all the extra contols, and adding a throttle that has a lot of buttons means you may not even touch your keyboard ingame. The Fighterstick tends to be at least 20 bucks more, so if you want the extra functionality, that's the price."

This stick has very very short throw buttons on it. Even the main trigger move very little when pressed. They all have very little throw to them but It makes it easy to trigger actions.

While with Doom 3, you just get, well... Doom 3. However I suppose the price for Doom 3 would be greater as it does have a bit of collectors value at this point, especially with the new Doom game about to drop between 2015 and 2016.

But it is your game, you own it. You can back it up to anyplace you like on your computer to have a ""local"" copy of it if you like. Been using Steam since it was Valve and never had any issues.

Make sure it is NOT the PRO version, unless you own a pro version. Your mouse throttle could be broken or a bad USB cable. I use mine for Microsoft FSX games. If you are using it for something else other than FSX, then that is out of my department."

yes/no,B00030GSJY,29-Jan-15,1422518400,Can you use joystick separate from the throttle? On some flight sims I just want to use the joystick by itself. Thanks.,?,"Likely no. The joystick plugs in to the throttle with a PS/2 Connector, and the Throttle goes to the PC with USB. I haven't personally tried connecting the throttle to a PS/2 connector on my PC, but I don't imagine it'd work. Not sure why there's not a picture of the connectors on Amazon, but http://www.techwarelabs.com/reviews/peripherals/saitek_x52/images/Complete%20Contents%20saitek%20X52.jpg shows the connector types."

open-ended,B00030GSJY,9-Jan-15,1420790400,How will this work with Elite Dangerous?,,That is what I bought it for. It works great for me. You can also setup the profile in ED the way you prefer. Takes a little adjusting and tweeking. So when you first start in ED use the trainer to test and get all the buttons assigned the way you want. I did not like the canned ED setup for the X52. So I did a custom setup and tested in the trainer before using it in game. Good luck

It exists for PC, Play Station 2, xbox (the old one, but I think the new one might play it), and for the Wii under a different name. These are the only formats I'm aware of, and I've done quite a bit of research. I personally own the PC and Wii versions."

I wont even talk about the pvp experience excpet to say that my death was swift...or more swife then usual :) My roomate hopped on the computer to take care of some business and even he said that this key board bites the big one. He was attempted to type up some documents and asked if I could put my old key board back on so that he could actully get his work done due to the keys not responding when he used them.

The Evo has pre-drilled holes that line up with the bottom of your G25 wheel platform and your G25 pedal platform, though you will have to offset the Evo pedal panel quite a bit to where it's strange looking but not impractical from a functional standpoint. Look into buying the additional Playseat Evo attachment for the G25 shifter. I don't think Amazon sells it ... I ended up getting that attachment from MaxWho.com."

You're somewhat limited in selection of wheels for the 360, but I'd recommend a Fanatec wheel. Preferably the multiplatform 911 Turbo S (clutch/H-shifter), but check their site out for yourself and see: www.fanatec.com Microsoft's wheel is decent to start out with, but if you're playing Forza 3 I'm sure you'll eventually want more.

There is significant steering lag with Dirt. Which means your going straight and your car is still turning, it makes for a very frustrating experience. Can't speak for how it runs on the 360 but on the PC it'll run good if you have a very powerful PC. Your best bet is to stick with a controller if you only have the PS3 version."

I do not see much difference except for the metal on the pedals which maybe makes them more durable. I use the pedals with Windows XP as my OS; the interface of my pedals is USB, the Saitek Drivers get the pedals into my computer and Saitek includes a program to check that the pedals are working. BUT to get the pedal info into any running program they have to be linked to the Windows Device Manager by going to the Control Panel and Clicking on Game Controllers, then clicking on ADD then scroll down to Saitek and select it.

There is no need to have your Red and White audio jack in the TV. The Xbox 360 will effectively bypass sending audio to the TV and will send the digital audio signal directly to the Pioneer. Then have fun. But if you want your TV to have surround sound make sure it is connected (Audio out) to the Pioneer.

open-ended,B000H683YC,15-Apr-09,1239778800,Remote won't control any Xbox function. Does yours? So the question is does your remote operate all the Xbox functions?,,mine works just fine. Be advised that all xbox control go through the IR port on the xbox itself (not the pioneer receiver). Make sure that you have a direct line between this port and the remote and try wiping the IR port on the 360 as it have have collected too much dust. The other option is that the IR port on your 360 simply is defective. I doubt it would be the remote or anything with the pioneer system since it performs it independent functions.
open-ended,B000H683YC,21-Jan-08,1200902400,Pioneer for Xbox 360 - Is it HDMI compatible? Does anyone know if the system is HDMI compatible?,,"This system (as far as I could read) has only Audio inputs. HDMI is an audio and video cable. If you are trying to connect this to an HDTV that has an HDMI input, then chances are that it has Digital Audio output too. Simply hook this digital output to the sound system. there will be some finer tweaks you need to workout with the tv such as whether the tv volume controlls the output volume and if the TVs speakers should then be turned off. For more personallized help, most High school to college aged boys/men, and an increasing number of women, have the knowlege required to get it working at a livable level. usually a trip to a Best Buy with a list of the items you have including brand and model number can prove very helpfull too."

As far as getting 5.1 surround sound from that connection I am unsure. I am sure that there is an adapter somewhere that plugs into the xbox and outputs a digital sound signal of either optical or coaxial types.
open-ended,B000H683YC,12-Dec-07,1197446400,"Standard Speakers?

open-ended,B000HZRLIM,22-Dec-14,1419235200,Is this really 199 dollars? And the expansion packs are 5? Really?,,"Alan, i can't really answer your question. The copy of this game that i have for sale is $150.00. The reason it is priced at $150.00 is that based on the other copies available at the time I listed it $150.00 seemed like a fair price based on what other seller were asking for their copies. Beyond that, I'm at a loss. I don't play video games and don't really know what an Expansion Pack involves and so I've no idea why they only cost $5.00. Perhaps there is less to them than the game itself."

I wouldn't let that bother you that much unless you are trying to get serious for real life racing there they use the toe/heel for gas and brake. I can tell you that I really like the seat even though I don't use it that often. I recently built a platform to mount it on and put small caster wheels on the bottom of it so I can easily move it around the room. I also ended up making a stop at the top of the pedals as they didn't want to stay in place as good as I would have liked. If I needed to buy another one this would be my choice.

They are easy enough to config and If you want to use the ""clutch button"" ""I"" you will need to disable clutch mode in the x52 control panel. The x52 pro it self is amazing for Elite Dangerous, I have had mine for a few months now and haven't had any problems.

open-ended,B000LQ4HTS,20-May-14,1400569200,"Is the base heavy enough to play with it resting on a desk, or does it need to be bolted down?",,"The answer is that it needs to be secured some way--especially the throttle. I went to Walmart and bought the sticky-back strip Velcro they have, stuck 2 strips of the pile side on my bench, and two matching strips of the hook part onto the throttle base and it works well. I don't secure the stick because it's heavier--occasionally if I get ""ham-fisted"" it lifts up slightly, but I just sit it back down and it's OK. Now if you have a very smooth desktop for the throttle, maybe the suction cups supplied with the throttle will hold it down, but my surface is unfinished wood, so the suction cups are not effective."

yes/no,B000LQ4HTS,30-Oct-13,1383116400,"Does the throttle work on it's own, since I'll be using a different stick? Thanks in advance.",Y,"Yes! Actually the main piece is the throttle part. The stick is cabled to the throttle using a Saitek proprietary cable so you will be ok if using a different stick and have this one as a backup. Another tip: don't use the throttle in a raw wood, if you do this the throttle will hot hold the position when you will use it. Nothing that can avoid the use but using it in a glass or solid table is the must considering you can use the 'suckers' (haha I don't know the name in english)."

Even has a twist lock if you plan to use it with rudder pedals. I would recommend that you mag mod the stick though as the stock sensitivity isn't all that great.

open-ended,B000MF67VO,30-Mar-09,1238396400,Mac OS X? Anyone know if this thing works at all on a Mac?,,This mouse DOES entirely work on OS X. They sell a white lit version labeled as the OS X version but all Death Adder mice are the exact same no matter what color they are. The only difference is you'll have to download the OSX driver from the website because there are only PC drivers on the disk.

Is this a better mouse than the copperhaad?,,"I haven't got to compare them, but the Copperhead in terms of performance is definitely better, but a lot of (right handed people) people might prefer the Death Adder because of the right-handed design. I own a Copperhead, it is the mouse to slay all other mice in terms of sheer performance, so slacking a little on performance really isn't that big of a deal. If I wasn't a lefty I'd probably prefer the Death Adder."

As of today, they release the trilogy all together now where some of the bonus content is included. Before purchasing, I'd do more research to make sure. This one I ordered did not though.

yes/no,B000OLXX86,17-May-14,1400310000,Should i buy 3 games separately or with trilogy. People say trilogy doesn't have dlc. Does these separate games come with the DLCS on amazon?,?,"For X360: Actually, the trilogy box set only has one DLC (for the first Mass Effect) that actually costs around $1-$5 by itself. With Mass Effect 2, there's the Cerberus Pass (which was once only available with a new purchase, but can now be downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace) and half of the DLC is free (go to Xbox Marketplace, find Mass Effect 2 DLC, and download Cerberus Network which is free, and you can download DLC from it which includes a new character, weapons armies and extra missions). Mass Effect 3 DOES need an Online Pass for online play, but some people were able to bypass this by having Xbox Live. Unfortunately, in both the trilogy and by itself, Mass Effect 3 contains NO DLC at all. The only free DLC is downloaded from Xbox Live Marketplace (it's add-ons for multiplayer, extra places to fight and more choices of bad guys to fight against). Every other DLC is not free. It doesn't actually matter which one you buy, as the only difference is the Bring Down the Sky DLC. Overall, the trilogy has only one DLC that isn't quite expensive while separately there are none. But if price matters, buy all three separately, as it can be cheaper sometimes by finding the right sellers. This may be kind of confusing but I hope I helped."

Unfortunately NO, that particular game does not have trophies. A particular good way that you can determine even before you purchase your game is to look very closely on the back cover of your games hard case. In the very top portion of the paper label (top Rh corner) opposite the Playstation Network name it will say (ADD ON CONTENT) and underneath both languages stating that will say (TROPHIES) that DOES NOT appear on your game in question. It IS on his AC II greatest hits, AC III, and also his RELEVATIONS. We hope that this has helped you.

I have a 'mixed-bag' hangar full of 200+ freeware and payware craft and all my Saitek panels work with all my planes/boats/vehicles without fail. Actually the panels make a lot of freeware pieces more fun due to a lot of them having a 2D 'pit instead of a VC.

I bought them based on the reviews but apparently these people that reviewed them are on their payrool or easily impressed. I found them to be flakey on their readouts, they are very small and the knobs are hard to work with. They do not preform as well as they are advertised either. Forget about tech support. I also found them to be a little too arrogant when it comes to telling them what is wrong with their product, and no help in correcting them. They might be good for a desktop flyer, but they did not live up to my expectations and I would not have bought them if I had not been misled on what programs they can be used for. They do not work with FS2002,FS2003, FS2004, FS9 but again flakey. They do work with FSX. (not the way I would like)Maybe you will have a better use for them than I did.

Win8 comes with a new desktop look, but still allows you to switch to the old familiar legacy Desktop, where it will run many legacy software programs.

You can use a sanwa joystick, but most mayflash units require you to cut the sanwa pcb (it's ok you direct solder the switches). Also, you have to either Dremel the joystick screw holes or buy smaller screws. Ettoki is awesome, he sells everything, smaller joystick screws, wiring harnesses, joystick, and buttons (crown and sanwa).

The key was inside the box... So obviously I had to wait. If you buy as a download, I would think key was available pretty much instantly, or at least at email speed. Me, I am old school.

Supposedly, going to Windows 8 from 7 does not enjoy the radical compatibility issues as going to 7 from XP. Here is one article that claims few issues will exist in the transition: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-Compatible-with-Windows-7-Hardware-and-Software-211576.shtml Here is a good article that discussed various scenarios: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-run-old-games-software-in-windows-8/ Here is an excellent tutorial discussing Windows 8 compatibility mode use. http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6832-compatibility-mode-use-windows-8-a.html Here is a link to a Big Fish post that suggests that their version will not run. http://forums.bigfishgames.com/posts/list/239885.page Here is a link to Microids (Microids is the original producer of Syberia) forum that talks about the game running slowly. I did not do a thorough search of the forum to see if other posts about Windows 8 compatibility exist. My best Guess: the Microids version will probably run OK; some adjusting of the game's properties through its or gfx options may be necessary. I do not know if the Big Fish version is altered from the original; that could introduce issues. Pardon my bias but I am wildly enthusiastic about this game, which I find to be challenging and just plain fun. To solve compatibility issues, I dual-boot XP/Windows 7 so I can keep running XP or earlier games that are not compatible with Windows 7. One is able to dual-boot Windows 7 and 8 - which is a viable option for you; a web search will give you many good tutorials on how to go about it. Post back if you have any questions. If it were me (it's not) I would buy grab the Microids version (you can query Amazon merchants to see what version they are selling) at least knowing that one person was able to run it on 8, albeit with some issues (that I suspect are related to his specific setup). Regardless, it, to me is worth the gamble. Ed"

open-ended,B001AWBYRA,1-Mar-15,1425196800,If I buy the physical copy of the game will that redeem on steam?,,No it won't; you would have to buy the Steam version. I bought the DVD version on purpose though just so I wouldn't be dependent on Steam (I do that with any game that is actually available on actual media).

Do you need to have the DVD on the system (external) to play it?,N,"Did you buy a physical ""DVD"" game or did you by a download game? I have the physical DVD game and I do not need to use the disc (after initial installation) to play the game. I purchased it this way intentionally because some of the online downloaded games have to be run through an online server like Steam and there fore can only be played while you are on line (WIFI connected) and I use my laptop while traveling and seldom have a WIFI connection. Since you don't have an internal DVD player your options would be to buy an external USB player (they can be very inexpensive, from 19.99 up) to download a physical DVD of the game or buy an on line downloadable version."

open-ended,B001B5U80K,22-Jul-13,1374476400,Will the disc copy be able to activate through steam with a product code or by other means?,,"There is no code. You literally just pop the disc in and install. However, any saves made with the steam version are compatible. I played the steam demo of torchlight, and then deleted the demo. The installer found the remaining nested directory within the steam folder and installed it there, allowing me to pick up where my character originally left off. Personally, I prefer a steam-free experience when possible. You can always add a link to this version through the add feature in steam client. However, you cannot add this version to your steam account."

yes/no,B001B5U80K,27-Feb-14,1393488000,Is Torchlight compatible with Windows 8?,?,I don't know if it is. I have windows 7 which it works wonderful. You could look at the specs on the back of the game on the amazon web site to see for sure.
open-ended,B001B5U80K,27-Feb-14,1393488000,"Is Torchlight made for any other game console, or just PC?",,All games have the platforms they are designed for plainly visible on their covers. Some might say Mac and PC some just PC. X-box and other console systems have their own unique platforms and manufacturers will specify those that will play another's platform in their instructions. The Torchlight game I purchased and is pictured here is for PC only.

It's not the most ideal for bassy music but it will hit all the notes. The Xonar is good, these are only 32 ohm and can be powered by most sources."
open-ended,B001BYMZ5W,7-Dec-14,1417939200,this or beyerdynamic dt 880? why?,,"The DT 880 doesn't have a mic, so if you have a decent external one, you should be covered. But personally I always prefer a full set. Their prices are almost the same, so I think you should go with gaming, IF you will use it as gaming headset."
open-ended,B001BYMZ5W,31-Jan-14,1391155200,"Do these headphones offer sidetone? That is, can you hear your own voice through the mic?",,You can always set that option through playback devices in Windows. Just right click on the mic device in playback and choose listen to.
open-ended,B001BYMZ5W,13-Jan-15,1421136000,Does this headset come with the USB Dac and also does it have Mic Monitoring?,,"No and no. These headphones only have standard audio jack connectors (3.5mm plug with a 1/4"" adapter). All the ""smarts"", if any, will come from whatever this is plugged in to."
open-ended,B001BYMZ5W,6-Dec-14,1417852800,is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line?,,I've owned about 5 headsets in the last 2 years. This has been the best headset I've found on the market when it comes to sound and mic quality. It does lack features like mic mute when boom is up and on can volume controls.
open-ended,B001BYMZ5W,6-Dec-14,1417852800,"can this hook up to ps3? ps4? i have a monitor with headphone jack, that works?",,"These will work with anything that outputs through a standard headphone jack. That being said, these headphones sound best when used with a decent amplifier. Using just a headphone jack will allow for sound in your ears but the mic will require a dedicated mic jack in addition to the headphone jack to use the microphone."

For those that are wishing for more hat switches you can use the three thumb buttons on the throttle as modifiers (similar to shift, ctrl or alt) to the main stick buttons in controller setup. This multiplies the buttons on the main stick: You essentially have 4 hats, 4 triggers, and 4x2 thumb buttons on the main stick. I just assign each throttle button to a ship function- like #1 = defensive countermeasures, #2 = navigating/docking operations, #3 = utility (i.e. deploy cargo scoop, silent running, etc.) and I have more than enough capability with this setup. Another nice feature that compliments the game is the middle detent in the throttle that allows you to easily locate zero-throttle versus reverse throttle. Highly recommend for Elite:Dangerous."

I have only played around with it for 30 minutes or so, but out-of-the-box, the joystick can control the trigger, select object in reticule, select nearest starfighter. The throttle sets the speed but not on a gradient; it's full on, 2/3, 1/3, and 0. There are buttons that set each of these too. I don't think there was anything else.

Some seldom used key combinations have issues. The one problematic key combination is CTL+R+any key. CTL+R does work fine though. Some use CTL to crouch in games (I use ALT) so you can see where CTL+R+W migt be an issue. http://prosperouspoverty.blogspot.com/2009/02/microsoft-sidewinder-x6-gaming-keyboard.html has a great write up on the board and addresses concerns for purchasers including the problematic key combinations. The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards. Additionally the non removable hand rest is higher than my Saitek Elcipse was so I haven't had a problem. This was my one main concern and I thought worse case I would put something under to slant it but I haven't had to.

You can get one for about $20. I like using all the different plane options, and it'll also teach you patience because dinner flights last pretty long. Overall I like it a lot.

It's pretty straight forward. However, Ive noticed that in BF4 there is a button or two that seems to be bugged. I use the two buttons in front of the throttle to afterburner, and it keeps opening up a damn menu. In all honesty, it works wonders in BF3...

Consisting of a throttle and a stick similar to a fighter jet set up in theory. This will add more to it as it also is Saitek and it allows functions not capable of the X52. This will be a nice addition to your setup.

I ordered one for my Mac without realizing the input jack on the laptop is line-level. The mic-level output is insufficient meaning no sound can be heard when speaking (although the headset *can* be used for listening). The Mac requires a USB or Bluetooth headset.

yes/no,B001FBHT34,16-Dec-12,1355644800,are these headsets adjustable and suitable for an 8yr old for 360 xbox live,?,"Yes, the headphones are adjustable. I've noticed that some reviews said that they weren't. Not true. Is it suitable for an 8 year old? I don't see why not. The 'phones are comfortable and well padded, which helps block outside noise. They also have a volume control and a mute button, which is good when your dad yells, ""Turn that dang thing off""! The mic is on an adjustable boom which can be pulled close or moved out of the way completely. That's what I do when I use them as studio headphones, which as I stated in my review, are surprisingly good. Now, for the last part of the question- I have no idea how an ""Xbox Live"" works. These headphones have the standard green, (for headphone), and pink, (for mic), plugs which mate with a computer. However I'm sure that there are suitable adapters. I use a mini to 1/4"" adapter to use them on my mixer. I hope this helps. Like I said, for the price they can""t be beat."

Does anyone know if this is the case with the versions included in this set, or has Ubi Soft added support for these releases?",,"I got past the lack of gamepad support on the first game by using a gamepad/keyboard mapper, Pinnacle Game Profiler in my case. However, there was a free one entitled Xpadder, though I am not sure if it is still free... It will allow mapping of a controller's buttons using the keyboard keys the game uses. Also, I didn't need one for Warrior Within since the game itself can map most gamepads I hear and had no problem using my XBOX 360 controller after setting it up myself. While I haven't played The Two Thrones yet, I am sure it's the same for that one too. Just Google the two programs listed above and you'll be fine I think! :)"

Here is a video of just one idea from Utube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGmBHoygJA There are other ideas out there too. If you insist of taking the leather off the wheel (from my experience - And I have had a G25 for years and bought me a G27 when one of my wheel buttons began to malfunction. I have modified the shifter so I can have sequential shifting but that is all I care to do to the wheel. If you decide to take off the wheel leather, I wish you luck as it looks like it is really on there. :) -Val"

I use mainly for racing but i can go around a track at 2 miles an hour or 102 or anywhere in between. for the money i recomend this wheel setup to anyone. i am sure the more expensive wheels have a better feature or two but not much better. also recomend iracing and asseto corsa for the most realistic racing experience available in my opinion, if into racing games."
open-ended,B001NT9TK4,19-Feb-14,1392796800,"Can the gears be moved to the left side of the wheel, or is it fixed on the right side?",,The gear shifter is not fixed to the steering unit and can be mounted anywhere you choose to mount it.
open-ended,B001NT9TK4,5-Aug-13,1375686000,"Does this wheel turn all the way around like a real car, or is it basically just the 190 degree rotation?",,It has up to 900 degress of rotation.
yes/no,B001NT9TK4,21-Jul-14,1405926000,Does the stick shift move just like in a real car?,?,"No it doesn't, it moves to where they are supposed to go but there is no spring that returns the stick shift to the neutral position after you take it out of gear. It kind of just sits there. In real cars the stick shift springs to center below 3rd gear and above 4th gear. This makes it so when you go from 2nd gear to 3rd gear you just have to push the stick up, instead of up, then right then up again. With the springing to center you just push it up and when it gets to neutral it springs right by itself and you just continue pushing it up to 3rd gear. (Sorry for the explanation which you probably already know, but it's for others who don't.)"
yes/no,B001NT9TK4,20-Oct-14,1413788400,has anybody tried this in ps4/? does it work,?,"this is the answer i got for the same question I am positive that the G27 will not work in the PS4 for now because of the absence of a Sony PS4 security chip in it. Without this chip, the G27 shuts down in 8 minutes. This is how Sony protects its PS4 license. It may work in the future if Logitech manages to negotiate a deal with Sony. The 8-minute shutdown restriction can surely be circumvented by a firmware upgrade. There is actually a petition going around among G27 owners for that to happen."
open-ended,B001NT9TK4,11-Nov-09,1257926400,What is G27 power supply voltage ratings? Is it 100-220V?,,"I just received my G27. It looks like the U.S. version will work in your country by just replacing the plug-in AC power cord if your outlet plugs are different from U.S. Fortunately that part plugs into the brick and should be easily replaced. The included power supply specs are: AC Input: 100 - 240Vac, 50-60 Hz, 1.0 Amp maximum DC Output: 24Vdc, 1.75 A LPS (Limited Power Source) Center = + (positive) It is a black brick design 105x47x27 mm. by APD (Asian Power Devices). It is pretty lightweight, 5.0 net wt. oz for the brick part. The output plug is a standard 2.1 mm ID (inner diameter) x 5.5 mm OD straight barrel about 12 mm long permanently attached output wire is approximately 5 feet long (about 1.7 meters). An L shaped barrel should also fit. The AC cord appears to be 6 feet (1.9 M) long with a standard non-polarized 2 flat blades without a third ground plug for U.S. outlets. The AC wire plugs into a standard looking figure 8 receptical on the brick. FYI, the most import AC adapter specs are ink stamped on the bottom of all Logitech wheel bases. I need a magnifying glass to read them. It looks like any standard laptop 24vac, 1.75 A AC adapter. P.S. I went overboard with the description because I recently discovered the adapter for my Logitech Driving Force GT disappeared during Spring cleaning. I have saved a lot of nondescript AC adapters half of which are no longer married to the original products. Logitech Customer Support blew off my request to buy a new part. They suggested buying a laptop AC adapter from a local electronics chain. I found those 24 Vac, 0.75 A. (DFGT spec, not G27), center positive adapters come in so many shapes and sizes, regulated and unregulated, long and short wires, and prices from 9.95 including shipping to US$130 plus shipping. I wish I had a detailed description of that part."

Do you think it makes squeaks or clicks or whatever that would annoy them?,,"Turning is relatively quiet, compared to the driving force gt. If u use the manual shifter it's quite loud, shifting, but the wheel turning isn't that bad. It does make a bit of noise tho but you should be fine if the there are others in another room. My girl sleeps in the other room when I sometimes stay up l8 to play, but it doesn't bother her. I would recommend. Good luck!"

yes/no,B001NXDBI6,30-Jan-14,1391068800,Is there anyway to use the usb 2.0 ports to make this a wireless keyboard?,Y,"This keyboard is not wireless capable. In the gaming community, wireless is unacceptable -- time lag, etc. This keyboard needs plugging into both USB2 and electricity. It even prefers a USB port on the computer itself, not on a hub. If you want a wireless, try the Logitech K350. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of a gaming board but is excellent in all other computer functions."
open-ended,B001NXDBI6,14-Jan-13,1358150400,Can the keys on the keyboard be set to individual colors or does the entire keyboard have to change at the same time?,,"Hi, unfortunately the whole set of keys will have the same colour. I figured out why individual keys are lighted so dim, it is largely due to having too small see-thru sections for the lighting to come through. Still, it is a sturdy keyboard. I am pounding on it and it is working fine. As for Mice, the corded G600 is excellent for its price. Superb Value. My hand doesn't cramp grasping it for hours on end."

Thank you!,,"The macros are not fully compatible with every program, So i do not know. Also keep in mind that its a gaming keyboard so its made mainly for gamers. I dont think the macros display on the LED screen on the keyboard, but they do have a separate program that lets you see all your macros that you program. Honestly though, this keyboard isn't as fantastic as it sounds, the youtube app doesn't even let you browse for certain videos :/"
open-ended,B001NXDBI6,26-Feb-15,1424937600,How do you use the LCD screen? I tried using the pad on here but it does not work.,,"What do you mean by using it? To navigate through the different apps you use the directional pads to either side of it. As for adding, removing and configuring the apps, you need to download and install the Logitech Gaming Software."
open-ended,B001NXDBI6,28-Dec-14,1419753600,where can I find an adapter plug to make it compatible for standard outlet,,"I assume that you're referring to the plug on the AC power adapter. That 2-prong AC plug fits any standard household 110 VAC power socket right out of the box... it doesn't need the 3rd (grounding) pin that you see on most AC power plugs nowadays. And, you can plug it in either way - it doesn't matter. Enjoy your keyboard."
yes/no,B001NXDBI6,31-Oct-14,1414738800,is it mechanical keyboard?,?,"No it's not a mechanical keyboard. If you HAVE to have a mechanical keyboard get the razor black widow. I actually returned the black widow for the g19 because my G15 gave out after 3 years, I got it used too (R.I.P), and I wanted to give the newer model of the g15 a chance.. I've never regretted it since. The display is amazing, the keys feel excellent. This is a 10/10 keyboard in my eyes. The screen tells you all the details you want to know about gaming. For instance, I play league of legends. It tells me my gold per second, current crit%, kdr etc.. its amazing. I love the volume scroll. You can play youtube off it slide shows and so much more!! Hope this helps, good luck!"

Although I never tried, I checked it out for you and it looks like ""no"". You may play against against the clock, or take your time; play yourself (solitare), the computer (and choose from 8 levels of difficulty) or against a human (who puts in their own identity) and plays against you wherever the two of you may be. Sorry about that, but I did not see internet options. It did, however, have some interesting perks: Auto Word Validation, Pop-up Hints if requested, and a few ""Best Plays"" if you ever just get stumped, as well as, a Merriam-Webster Official Scrabble Dictionary built right in.

yes/no,B001UIG6M2,2-Mar-15,1425283200,Can I use it to Play japan imported games on a US ps2,?,"I couldn't even get mine to play a European copy of the movie Tank Girl staring Lori Petty. My PS2 is a US MODEL # SPCH-77001. It is a slim, soft modded, and will not play black bottom or blue bottom disc's so I can't use my GameShark to launch anything which is why I like the Action Replay Max due to it having a silver bottom which is the same for the Swap Magic, so be sure of what kind of bottoms your PS2 can play. The Action Replay is to allow you to turn your PS2 into a region 0 or region x DVD drive reader for movies and not games. So no it won't let you play your imported games. I would go with a Swap Magic if you are looking to play backups or imports on your PS2. I have Swap Magic and it allows me to play all my backups, imports, and I even have a back up of my Action Replay Max because my soft moded PS2 won't play the original but my backup copy will and it works with my backup games. You can find PS2 Swap Magic NTSC USA here on Amazon or on ps2cover.com or stoneagegamer.com who are selling it for $24.74 plus tax on ps2cover and sold out on stone age gamer, and that's without the lid for the slim ps2 if you have a fat ps2 you will need the slide tool. If you have a slim u will need the flip top cover unless you soft mod your slim like I did and then you don't need the flip top but I'm thinking of picking up the lid and buying another slim PS2 and use it on that and not soft mod it because then I can probably use my region free function and watch my import DVD's using my Action Replay MAX. ""Be sure to get the NTSC U.S.A. version of swap magic if you have a U.S. PS2"". The PAL version is for non North and South American PS2'S so be sure of what version you are purchasing. If u want to play backup PS1 and imported PS1 games on your PS2 I would recommend the Breaker PRO NTSC, and this can be found on ps2cover also for $19.95. I still need to buy one due to my PS2 won't read my GameShark due to it's blue bottom. I hope this helped you and also the Swap Magic NTSC version 3.8 DVD comes with some cheat codes but I haven't had any games to try them out with. When i bought my Swap Magic it stated that the DVD disc was version 3.6 but I received version 3.8 along with version 3.8 CD. I hope i was able to help you out a little bit."

However, in searching the internet, you can find proper cheats for the game, including leveling up faster, always getting an item with a monster battle, always going first.

And note, when I say, Operating System - it's just the environment that the game runs in, not your overall PC Operating System Environment. With Windows you can keep checking as it checks each prior version of Windows to see which one the game works on, and when it does, it will ""Set"" it in its memory. That way whenever you do run the game in the future, it knows what settings it needs in order to run. Good Luck."

If you don't have a VCR, your local thrift shop is sure to have one, but get it quick before they're all gone :) Make sure that the VCR has composite outputs that are compatible with your new digital television.

I first transitioned by using the keyboard to the left and at times hit some of the keys on the regular keyboard to play. I do believe that you will be very happy with it!"

The feel is very good, so some people think it is mechanical; I can't tell by using it. I recommend you find a Bestbuy that has one and check it out; you can probably even get them to hook it up to a pc so you can try it. Then thank them for their time and buy from Amazon for the better price :)"

Else the standard reflectors works just fine and it seems very responsive to me. No discernible lag whatsoever."

It's used in gaming to translate your head movement into corresponding movement in game. For example, in a flight simulator (where I use it), it is used to control your view in 3d cockpits, giving 6 degrees of freedom in the cockpit as if you were really there. It is fantastic and I highly recommend it."

open-ended,B0029M6VKA,27-Dec-14,1419667200,Does it need to be in a well lighted room to work? And how much do you need to move for it to work?,,"No, it uses IR technology to ""see"". It has 4 IR LEDs inside the unit that provides it's own light. The light from these IR LEDs reflects off the attachment on your head (Pro-clip or the one that comes with this item) and back to the main unit where it records the location of the reflections. The following are images I googled to elaborate on how the TrackIr can ""see"": https://www.google.com/search?q=ir+led&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS547US547&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=993&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=xr6eVOqhC4apyQSgv4GgAw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=ir+led+effects+on+digital+camera&spell=1&facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=xIRi19iwEBxv_M%253A%3BwxkUqO9lMLcJYM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F6%252F67%252FP1020168.JPG%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FInfrared%3B2560%3B1920 Your next question is tougher to answer. Within the software that runs the system you can modify how much you have to move (its resolution). Just like the DPI settings for your mouse. I'm pretty sure if you were to make it as sensitive as possible you could spin your character's view quicker than you can see things on the screen. Like taking your mouse and wiggling it vigorously and the mouse cursor almost becoming invisible, if you know what I mean."

yes/no,B002AQNT96,30-Oct-14,1414652400,Will this run on XP SP3????,?,"I wouldn't advise it. Since Microsoft servers do not support a lot of XP systems anymore. I suggest upgrading to Windows seven. I have Windows 7 Ultimate and a great video card. If you do this, make sure your power supply in your pc can handle a better video card. Otherwise, you can damage your system."

They do not ever use the ""F"" word and you will often hear them using other words purposefully instead of the actual curse word. But, they will say curse words every now and then.

The game involves shooting zombies so there is a lot of gore in it. Heads and limbs are blown off the zombies. I have seen in the options where you can turn down the gore, but of course I have never tried it. Its a fun game where you have to learn to work with teammates to survive. I'm not a mother so I really don't know what age I'd recommend, but if I had to I'd say... high school, maybe the middle school age if you turn down the gore."

I will caution you however that the PS3 version is not really very good due to its hardware limitations etc. It's playable, but tends to be very laggy in high traffic areas.

Although this game is so addictive, YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION BY ANY WAY, there's no offline game, even the main story needs a monthly fee. YES, it's a dumb.

open-ended,B002BSA20M,24-Feb-15,1424764800,Why is it mature?,,"It has mild blood, violence, very little language. It just BARELY scrapes up to mature. I have had this talk with a bunch of people wanting to get their child Reach. It should not be rated Mature, and the thousands and thousands of times I have played it I have never felt ""disturbed"" or like it was inappropriate for children. You DO do things like run aliens over, or jab a knife in their brainpan, but it is just comic violence. Like LEGO games; isn't it morbid to hit someone and have them explode into pieces? ;) Just saying, this game has violence but it is very mild. Many of the Halo games are not deserving of their Mature rating. Hope this helps you some!"

yes/no,B002BSA20M,22-Jul-14,1406012400,Is this halo reach game work on pc's? (laptops),N,"In short, no. Halo 1 & 2 were ported to the pc, but they stopped doing that after 2. All the other Halo games (Reach included) only work on the consoles they were made for. The only way to play Reach on the pc is to do some serious hacking, or use an illegal torrent to download a hacked copy. The one pictured here was specifically made for the xbox 360, so it will not work on a pc (again, not without some serious hacking)."
open-ended,B002BSA20M,4-Jul-14,1404457200,Is XBox live (or internet connection) required to play?,,"No. At least, not for the campaign (story mode), which can be played locally by two persons. Matchmaking is the only part of the game where Xbox Live Gold is highly advisable. I'd recommend Internet connection with a base Live account (no gold) if you want to keep track of your records and achievements."
open-ended,B002BSA20M,11-Jun-14,1402470000,"Can anyone tell me which game is better, Halo 4 or Halo Reach?",,"Depends on the kind of fun you want. Bungie did Reach so there is a lot of fun to be had where the characters are actually funny and the playability is great. Halo 4 (not Bungie) takes itself far more seriously little to no ""fun"" stuff, just an attempt to make the story more serious. Halo 4 has immensely better graphics and if you like thick plot and story and a solid multi-player then that's your game (co-op is completed in less than a few days so not worth it for just that). Reach was the pinnacle of Bungie's evolution of the game, a must-have for any Halo fan. I personally don't consider Halo 4 even part of the franchise, more of a spinoff because it's SO different."
open-ended,B002BSA20M,11-Jun-14,1402470000,How does this game differ from Halo 4? Is it better?,,"Reach does not have John in it. It is a team of Spartan IIIs. You will be Noble 6. Fighting the covenant attacking Reach. The play is the same in that you kill as many covenant as possible while achieving your team's mission. I liked it better than Halo 4 because I enjoyed playing as part of a team of spartans. Not to say I did not like Halo 4. Also, you get to choose what your armor looks like. Hope this helps."

This is to make it compatible with 4 core an more CPU/processors (game was built when 2 core's were common) an other things. Now for modding which I have done, I have no issues with Windows 7 nor should you with Windows 8 (I am aware of it's problems, why I stayed at W7 Pro). because there are mods & fixes for everything at NexusMods. Please remember to install game in folder other than Program Files because Windows UAC feature causes problems. For example C:Games/Fallout3. Also note that Windows Live no longer exists so you can not validate it nor do you have to. You essentially are buying this so not to get malware or viruses from pirated copies or you just do not want to wait forever to download it off steam. Took me 5 days to get it running good with over 50GB worth of mods. Great learning experience, awesome game, 10000X better than when I first played it."

The internal battery just determines certain in game events and anyways that can be replaced). There isn't any way to tell if the game is fake or not until you have it in your hand (seeing as online sellers can use real images from anywhere and state they are theirs) and when purchasing it's purely based off of trust."

Hello, I had the same problem and found the perfect solution online (for just $2.99): In order to fix this problem you just need a larger knob which provides the extra leverage needed to (effortlessly) turn the knob. The original knob should come off easily by wiggling and pulling at the same time. The knob is attached to a 1/4'' shaft so any larger knob that fits a 1/4'' shaft will do fine. I used one from radio shack (Model: 274-407), which was 1/4'' shaft and it also contained a micro screw that you can tighten to ensure a snug fit. This knob slightly covers the labels (ALT,VS IAS, etc) but because these values show up on the screen as you tune to them, it's no big deal for me. Btw, I attempted to contact Saitek for a solution and shocker! -No Response."

open-ended,B002I0H2AG,7-May-14,1399446000,I played Gears of War 3 and liked the campaign. Should I give this game a try? Is it a must play for 360 owners? I am only interested in single player.,,"I'd say yes, especially if you are a fan of the series. It's pretty much on par with Gears 3 as far as graphics game play etc. I too only purchased it for the campaign mode. One thing judgement has is; you'll come to a variety of different types of side/bonus missions that are optional during the campaign. You'll know when you come to them, because there will be a red gears emblem on the wall, and they aren't hard to find. Walk up to it and you can either accept or deny if you want to play it. It's kinda like horde mode on online. You and the crew have to face usually two waves of various types of enemies. So it's kind of like a run and gun type of affair. You'll earn stars, badges, etc for completing/doing various things when playing them. So that adds to the campaign as well. I am very pleased with my purchase. I've only completed the first few chapters; because I bought 7 other games at the time. So I have a lot of love to spread around, lol. Another recommendation that I have for you is Tomb Raider if you haven't played it already. That's where most of my gaming time is spent. It's a very good game, and I highly recommend it. I'm playing it on the ps3 however. I would definitely recommend Gears judgment as well since you are a fan of the series. I noticed the other answers were short, so I tried to provide additional information to help you out with your decision. Hope this helps with determining whether you purchase it or not. You won't be disappointed though..."

This is highly misleading and quite frankly dishonest.,,"A little extra clarification for the only other answer: the original Final Fantasy XIV did not do well critically and was basically scrapped/pulled offline. The game was given to a new development team for improvements and re-released under the title ""Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn"" in 2013. I do not know for sure that this game does not ""work"" anymore or that it won't automatically upgrade to A Realm Reborn, but if you are considering buying it then it's probably a good idea to purchase Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn to be safe. Also for potential buyers: please note that A Realm Reborn is NOT an expansion--you do not need to buy this in order to play A Realm Reborn."
open-ended,B002I0JJ2U,18-May-14,1400396400,"If I get this one, will it update to ARR or is that a seperate game altogether?",,"You should be able to upgrade for free to ARR. However, in order to avoid any oddities, since you wouldn't have an existing account, simply purchase the FFXIV: ARR for convenience."
open-ended,B002I0JJ2U,26-Jan-15,1422259200,Does this come with one disc or two (The game disc and the Eorzea The making of a realm disc)?,,"One disk, but, good luck getting help activating the game. Square Enix is really bad with their customer Support. I've had this game for over a year and still can not get it activated."
open-ended,B002I0JJ2U,13-Jul-14,1405234800,Do you know if it has the Garmond Goggles Code or is of the first batch?,,"think the goggles were an item you had to quest or so. All I can find out is if you had them in 1.0 it carries over into ARR. Does it just give them to you for buying the game, the answer is as far as I can see. No. The goggles themselves are actually a EU 1.0 Preorder bonus. http://xivdb.com/?item/2632/Garlond-Goggles"

It will soar with your system and you will be amazed at how well it is designed and how beautiful it all is. You will be able to use the highest settings, the system is so well balanced that with hundreds of thousands of players spread out over scores of servers, it has no lag at all. Enjoy."

open-ended,B002I0KP4G,25-Nov-14,1416902400,"I'm buying this for my boyfriend and I'm clueless, is buying the collectors edition worth it? What weight does it hold?",,"It really depends on if he also plays Diablo 3 or World of Warcraft. Collectors editions come with bonuses for all 3 of those games. For example, this one would give his D3 characters special wings & also an in-game pet for WoW."

The game plays great for me, though I've only ran it on low settings. Out of all Blizzard games, SC2 plays the smoothest on my Mac. It should play fine on your machine, but recommended RAM is 4GB (2GB minimum). I'd go to at least the 4GB if you haven't already."

yes/no,B002I0KP4G,13-Jun-14,1402642800,Does the latest version of 13 inch retina 128GB works for this game?,Y,"Yes it does, though I wouldn't recommend trying to run the graphics on Ultra/Extreme on anything with a less than 2.6Ghz processor same as Wings of Liberty. However you can still run graphic on High you might be able to get away with Ultra if your Graphics card is good enough."

I want its profile to change automatically for each program.,?,I'm not familiar with their the Logitech gaming framework. But with the set point driver installed you can customize an unlimited amount of profiles saved on your computer and the profile will be loaded for whichever program has focus. if the program does not have a profile the general profile is used. this all happens on the fly behind the scenes.

I have been using the G5 for 5+ years now but may need a upgrade.,,"Hi, I only saw your reply today hence the late reply. Maybe it's just me but the G500 is too bulky and the build quality is lower than the G5 in my opinion, for example when you click the mouse button it feels slightly loose on the G500. In my opinion, the G500 is not the mouse to upgrade to. I'm not sure which mouse to go to tbh. Right now I using the G5 again and the G500 is in the drawer."

Are the clicks very loud at night? thx,,I don't feel it's all that loud but if you are gaming and repeatedly mashing the mouse button hard and fast in a completely silent house I am sure that it could disrupt someone from sleep but I think most mice would do that. This has been my all time fave mouse I have bought 4 of them and been the most happy with both the shape and the way you can weight it to be the right feel for you.

yes/no,B002J9GDXI,21-Sep-13,1379746800,"Button 10 (left side, red square) Has anyone gotten this to work on games?",?,The only way to do it is to set a macro and just set to a key on your keyboard and set the action to that key in game. Windows doesn't seem to recognize the button.
open-ended,B002J9GDXI,11-Mar-13,1362985200,"Anyone used this with a KVM switch? Logitech's web site doesn't commit either way; it says ""KVM switches may affect the functionality of your G500.""",,"I only used my KVM with my MX518, and that worked fine. I can't say I ever used a KVM with my G500 though(left click switch went bad in under 1 year btw, I just bought the G700). I suspect the KVM switch would not effect the standard functionality. Any lack of operation would probably be more specific to the KVM's quality or compatibility with the mouse due to voltage or signal loss through the KVM."

If you're gonna use it for a SNES or NES emulator, it will work perfectly as it's just to plug in, set controls and you're done, just like a regular gamepad. I use Windows 7 myself, but as it's plug n play, it will most probably work for Windows 8 OS too."
open-ended,B002JAU20W,6-Jan-15,1420531200,Does this work with GameBoy/GameBoy Color/GameBoy Advanced? Does this act as a keyboard by using normal keyboard signals?,,"No. It doesn't work at all. Doesn't ship with a driver, windows 7 and 8 cannot find a driver, and i couldn't find one on google that would work. It's nothing but a paperweight."

You would think when factoring in the cost of delivery and the materials it would be about the same,,"Here's my hunch: 1. Microsoft doesn't want any online codes being sold for much cheaper than they're selling them, so they maintain pretty strict control over the price (i.e. it's the same everywhere). 2. When retailers sell the physical cards, they typically sell it for the card face value. Since they have inventory and distribution costs for this and still want to make a profit off of the sales, Microsoft still has to sell the cards to retailers at a lower price, say $20 less. 3. Amazon or its vendors get a similar deal as brick-and-mortar retailers on these cards, but they have lower costs than brick-and-mortar stores. So they can afford to sell these cards at a lower price than face value, and it ends up being lower price than the online codes. The economic incentives are all wrong here, and sadly until Microsoft and other vendors properly take this into account, there will continue to be wasteful distribution of physical cards when selling an electronic code is better for everyone."

However, using a wired controller, you only need to plug in the USB, start your game, go to control settings, and make sure ""360 controller"" or simply ""controller"" is enabled. The following are instructions for a wireless 360 controller. 1. You need to have or purchase a wireless gaming receiver. Assuming you have windows, the software should automatically install after a few minutes. 2. Like most wireless gaming controllers, a ""search"" button will allow you to connect with your device. However, first you need to press the search button on the receiver. Then, press the search button on the controller. 3. If you do not connect, check your batteries and open up the ""My Computer"" window to make sure your receiver is connected. (Usually it will appear under devices) 4. You may need to configure some settings in-game to make sure the buttons are bound to the right control. 5.

open-ended,B003O6EDSM,15-Aug-14,1408086000,how much space is required,,5.3G minimum (for PlayStation 3)..but to be safe I would keep more than that free because it doesn't specify if that's for one game of the entire trilogy.

open-ended,B003O6G5TW,8-May-14,1399532400,What Dose Wrong Disc Region Mean??,,"Xbox game discs only work with Xbox consoles that are sold in the same region. For example, if you purchase an Xbox 360 console in North America, you cannot play game discs that are sold in Europe or in Asia. An Xbox 360 console that is sold in Europe can only play game discs that are sold in Europe, and an Xbox 360 console that is sold in Asia can only play game discs that are sold in Asia. It is not possible to make an Xbox 360 from one region play discs that were produced for another region. Back to the top THINGS TO TRY 1. Determine whether the game disc is from the same region as the region where you purchased the Xbox console. To verify the region, view the back of the game package. Look for a one of the following codes: * NTSC: North America and South America (United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Brazil) * NTSC-J: Asia (Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) * PAL: Europe, South Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand 2. If this symptom occurs with only one or two discs, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for the specific game title or titles. If you find a known problem, follow the information that is discussed in the article. 3. If this behavior occurs with only one or two discs, and no known problem exists, return the disc or discs to the retail store where you made the purchase. 4. Turn off and unplug your console, remove the Hard Disk Drive unit and any attached Memory Units, and then reconnect your console. Try the disc again. If this appears to resolve the issue, turn off and disconnect your console, re-attach the HDD and MU, and then delete any saved games for the game title in question."
yes/no,B003O6G5TW,27-Apr-14,1398582000,Is it a good idea to install both disc 1 and 2 to the system hard drive?,?,It depends on how much space you have on your console. If you Don't have a lot of space on your console then don't do it. If your console has a lot of space then maybe. Don't just fill your hard drive completely or it would cause some lag. If you found this helpful then great. If not I am sorry for wasting your time.

Here is some info that may be helpful: EDITION: We sort our books by the ISBN (10-digit unique number) of each book. So when you see our listing, the edition will match the information posted. Sometimes a vendor will sell a previous edition under the most recent listing; that is why you will see other vendors specifying an edition number to clarify that they are selling a different edition than the one listed. If you search for your book by its ISBN and find our listing, it should be the correct edition you are looking for. CDs AND DVDs: We try to make sure to list in the comments section if a disc is included with the book or not. If the comments do not specify, the book does *not* usually include a CD. STUDY GUIDES: Unless specifically noted otherwise in the comments, we sell study guides and textbooks separately. A textbook from us will *not* include the study guide. CONDITION: We sort our inventory by condition according to the following guidelines: Like New - Undamaged cover, no missing pages, all pages undamaged (no creases or tears), no underlining/highlighting of text, no damage to binding, no writing in margins. (Could easily be mistaken for brand new.) Good - Very minimal damage to the cover (no holes or tears, only minimal scuff marks), dust jacket not necessarily included, minimal wear to binding, majority of pages undamaged (minimal creases or tears), highlighting/underling acceptable on textbooks as long as text readable and it is not an excessive amount, no missing pages. Acceptable - Some damage to the cover but integrity still intact, binding slightly damaged but integrity still intact, possible writing in margins, possible underlining and highlighting of text, no missing pages. (Item beaten up a bit but it works.) If an item has some unusual type of damage, such as water damage or a binding so badly damaged that it is falling apart, it should be noted in the comments.

yes/no,B003Q55Y5C,11-Nov-14,1415692800,Will this run on Windows XP SP3?,?,"not very well, it will run, but expect tons of errors and graphical glitching... it will also depend on your hardware, but the worst graphical glitch you will encounter will be the crash scene. advice: pass this game by, its not worth the frustration/being so linear/and all the issues and inconsistencies just aren't worth it in my opinion. complaint: by far the worst game released in the last 15 years, hands down. story line is almost nonexistent. gameplay mechanics are terrible."
open-ended,B003Q55Y5C,1-Jun-14,1401606000,"what are system req, ments for this game. will my hd 7870ghz do it justise? and is the gameplay good?",,Not sure what your processor or memory capability is but I used an 8800GT video board and the game worked fine. Game play is above average to good.
yes/no,B003Q55Y5C,27-Jul-14,1406444400,"Will the game support a Logitech F310 gamepad, combined with a 2Ghz/Win7/D-Core/4Gb ram/Directx-11 environment? 2nd: Plz confirm NO ""Steam"".",?,"1. That gamepad will support Homefront. 2. We need more information about the system specs, since there's a huge difference between a 2 Ghz Intel Celeron and a 2 Ghz Intel i3/i5 multi-core processor. Would also need to know what kind of graphics card you have. Looking at the minimum system requirements, though, you need at least an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 2.8 GHz to run this, so I don't think you'd be able to do much with the game. 3. The game does require Steam. 4. I'm an avid PC gamer and have had a Steam account since a few months after it was launched. While I have had a few issues (I can count maybe 4 out of the 600+ games in my library), the issues have never been inherently related to Steam. Homefront ran just fine for me."
yes/no,B003Q55Y5C,3-Jun-14,1401778800,Does the online still work in 2014?,?,In short - no. There are still a few private servers scattered about here and there but it's officially dead in the water.
yes/no,B003Q55Y5C,12-May-14,1399878000,does it come with a steam key?,?,"The version I purchased, did not. You can purchase it through steam, however I liked having the discs and if memory serves, it was less expensive from Amazon. I do have it listed in my steam library and can boot from steam that way."

open-ended,B003Q9RGRW,9-Apr-15,1428562800,"do i have to use the headphones that come with it, or can I still use my blue tooth head set?",,"You should still be able to use any headset with it, it's essentially an extended microphone jack. I'd still research outside of amazon to be sure."
open-ended,B003Q9RGRW,21-Feb-15,1424505600,Is the end of the head set only for xbox or could you use it for a computer too?? Thanks for your answers!!!!!,,The manual says it's only for the xbox 360.

open-ended,B003Q9RGRW,16-Jan-15,1421395200,can I use the pad with Netflix or Pandora or internet explorer? as if it was a pc keyboard?,,"Yes, I use it on netflix all the time. It works well. The mic broke like 3weeks or so. Didn't last long, but I mainly bought it for the pad."
yes/no,B003Q9RGRW,14-Jan-15,1421222400,does it come with the headset,?,"I would say no this is listed as only chat pad, but read the seller description if it doesn't say anything about the headset assume it isn't included."

yes/no,B003RS1A7Y,13-May-14,1399964400,is it compatible with rocksmith guitar game for PS3 ?,?,"Hi! No, because Rocksmith converts the analog signals from an electric guitar with its special cable, and this guitar is basically sending a MIDI (digital) signal. I hope that helps... I know I wanted to do the same, but ended up buying a nice Acoustic/Electric (Ovation) for Rocksmith."

open-ended,B003RS1A7Y,17-Jun-14,1402988400,What other midi devices does this work with? Can I use on my computer?,,Yes but you will need an adapter for it
yes/no,B003RS1A7Y,25-May-14,1401001200,Is it compatible with PAL system?,?,"As far as I know, it's only dependant on system (Xbox/PS) and should work in any region. That being said, I only tested the regional functionality on keyboards (wich work well US-&gt;EU). Cheers!"

I have seen a few videos on youtube abut the guitar use check them out. it`s fun to play with. hope this was helpful,have fun jerry"
open-ended,B003S9WJ9A,2-Dec-14,1417507200,Is this the official cable pictured or another copy from Asia?,,"The last time I checked, when I clicked the link to go to the product page, one of the pictures IS the official cable because of the embossed Microsoft logo, however, when I ordered one, I got a knock-off. I just recently found a first-party cable at Wal-Mart for twice as much, but at least I now have one that I know for a fact as first-party. As I said in my review, just to stay safe, your better off looking elsewhere because you don't have that guarantee here. I hope this helps."
yes/no,B003S9WJ9A,17-Apr-14,1397718000,Would it work if I have a 320gb hdd first generation of Xbox's for I want to transfer my data from my 60gb to the 320gb?,Y,"Yes, you can transfer any memory to all 360's. (Arcade/Pro/Elite etc.) It is possible to transfer data to slim from any old 360 as well too. The only problem is slim to slim HDD, and that's because the casing is built different. This old transfer cable will plug into a slim 360's USB port, but the other end will not fit into the hard drive. There is slim adapter for the fit of the the newly built casing, but money and time can be saved when you take apart the old 360/slim HDD's. Then you can place the old hard drive into the slim casing and screw it back together. That's just a shortcut I would take if I don't need any further memory yet."
yes/no,B003S9WJ9A,13 days ago,,Can you play games directly from the external hard drive with this cord?,?,"As far as I understand it, the hard drive, once formatted with the third party cable, ONLY works if the cable is plugged into the system and the hard drive (which should now be 32 GB) is linked with the cable and NOT where the hard drive originally should be. This is due to the hard drive now being read as an external storage device. If you have a first party cable, then once you have moved your data, the cable has done its job and is no longer necessary. It all comes down to if you have a cable straight from Microsoft or one from another company. I hope this helps. =-)"
open-ended,B003S9WJ9A,14-Jan-15,1421222400,does this cable hook up to the xbox and transfers from the xbox 360 to the new hard drive or does it hook up directly to the old hard drive??,,"How most cables should be set up for the original 360s are where you place whatever hard drive you WANT to transfer content TO needs to be connected to your system, and your existing hard drive needs to be connected with the box end of the cable. The USB end connects to the back of the system where you would plug a wireless adapter or some other accessory. Be warned about my review however; if its third party, you could wipe your new hard drive. I do NOT know about the slim or X1 looking models. I hope this helps answer your question. :-)"
yes/no,B003S9WJ9A,25-Dec-14,1419494400,Can this cable transfer xbox 360 slim hard drives to xbox 360?,Y,Yes it can.

yes/no,B003S9WJ9A,16-Jun-14,1402902000,Can you use it to permanently connect an old 360 hdd for saving games and such?,?,"In the directions it explicitly says 'not intended for long term use'. So I would say no, but I haven't tried."

To my knowledge Amazon was threatened w/ a lawsuit from I'm not sure who but according to the reps at Elgato capture selling HDMI strippers as the action itself was illegal. I'm not sure if that somehow affects your situation but the ones I purchased also didn't work but for a few hrs."

yes/no,B003UYOEMI,16-Apr-14,1397631600,"Can I set it up with a laptop to two TVs, and have the TVs act as extensions to the desktop and not just copied?",?,Not unless your computer has the option to extend its display. Even so the two tv's would show the same image as this is a splitter...

open-ended,B003UYOEMI,23-Sep-13,1379919600,Does this work with chromecast? Does it have auto switch?,,I am not sure how you intend to use it with Chromecast. Are you intending to split the signal received by the Chromecast dongle? I would assume that it would work fine but I could be wrong. The Sanoxy unit worked well the HDMI output of my receiver to take it to two TV's.
yes/no,B003UYOEMI,29-Aug-13,1377759600,Will this product work with a Motorola DCX3200-M HD cable box provided by Charter?,?,I don't know. I'm using HDMI male to male from computer to two HD TVs. Sorry.

I thought I would have to reprogram the buttons but it worked great out of the box. It's the exact same style controller as our Xbox 360 controllers. In fact I think these are a more comfortable fit. It worked a little funky at first but I realized that was my fault. I had to flip the switch on the back of the controller from X to D. I think that's from Xbox mode to Direct mode. After that it worked great and I was able play on Steam."

Go to http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/gamepad-f310?crid=411&osid=14&bit=64 for the controller, click downloads in blue, and underneath the controller image you will be able to choose windows 8 (32 or 64 bit) for the drivers. I'm sure they are on the cd provided too. If not, you can just get them off the site."
yes/no,B003VAHYQY,10-Mar-13,1362902400,DOES IT WORKS WITH A MAC???,Y,"It works, but you have to flip the switch on the bottom to ""D"". Some games may need Gamepad Companion, which will recognize the controller when it is switched to ""D"" and then let you map the buttons and joysticks to keyboard key presses and mouse movement. I just tried it with Solar 2, and the game detected it (in ""D"" mode) but all the buttons were mixed up and so it was nearly impossible to play. So you might have to use Gamepad Companion to map the buttons to keys to get around that for some games."

yes/no,B003VAHYQY,25-Feb-14,1393315200,"I need some help, would this controller be better for racing games like NFS over the arrow keys on a keyboard?",Y,"I would say yes, the analog sticks give you more precise movements because they are analog not just a digital on/off signal such as arrow keys, but does take some getting use to, so at first you will be worse. in my opinion, however, if you want this for racing games, I highly recommend buying a cheaper racing wheel over a gamepad, provided you can spend a little extra $$$ and space isn't a huge issue. even a cheap $50 racing wheel will be 1000 times more realistic and precise feeling than a gamepad. If you dont have much cash, maybe a cheap thrustmaster steering wheel would fit well? If you have plenty of money to blow and you are really into racing games, nothing beats a logitech G27. period. (I am currently using a microsoft sidewinder steering wheel from the early 2000's and I LOVE it, im very into racing games and wish I had money for the G27..."

Please see the following response found on Yahoo answers: ""The deadzone is the region of movement which is not recognised by the device. Generally this is in the region around the center position. Leave your joystick centered. Now using a very light touch, slowly move it in any directon until on the screen the cursor or pointer moves. (repeat in other directions also) The region (or amount of movement) that the joystick can physically move without registering any change is the deadzone for the stick. Varies from model to model, in some you can even adjust manually or by software the amount of deadzone in both the X and Y axis.""

Thanks in advance!,?,"I myself do not own an F710 but I've seen it and held it in my hands. The answer to your question is yes its a bit thinner and lighter than the F710. What I like about these devices, they have a switch on the underside to switch from Dinput to Xinput. What that means is your device can be seen by very old games which support Dinput (old controllers style) and it can be set to play new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers when switched to Xinput. Once set to Xinput any new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers can be played by this device."

open-ended,B003VAM392,13-Oct-13,1381647600,does it work on steam? and is there the deadzone problem?,,"Yes it will work on Steam providing that the game have support for controllers. For games that is on Steam which do not have controller support you can use an emulator like Pinnacle Game Profiler. You can go there website at ""pinnaclegameprofiler.com"" and download a thirty days full trial of the software to emulate games on Steam which do not have controller support. As to your second question...There is no dead-zone problem with this particular gaming device unless you bought it faulty or if it has taken a bad fall from you or someone else. One thing though as any other product, overtime as you put pressure on the analog sticks they will start to come of the dead-zone but that my be years from now or months from now depending on how often you use it for gaming. Sometimes lets say for e.g. a first person shooter game if you need to do some quick running or looking around and the tension in the game will have you putting pressure on the analog sticks, so that in itself will, after time throw off the dead-zone."

open-ended,B003VANOFY,10-Mar-14,1394434800,"Is the wireless quality really ""Gaming grade""? Can anyone compare to the wired version of the product? I have that one now.",,"As a game developer, I use these headsets religiously. They are not the best quality, but compared to 90% of wired headsets near the same price range they are just as good. Only problems I have with the headset is the boom for the microphone. The elbow that attaches boom to the left headphone is made out of plastic and if dropped on that elbow it will break with ease. (I strength my headsets by attaching 38 gauge aluminum with some liquid steel adhesive, to the elbow join) I have used a number of these headsets and currently own three. Two for work and one for home. Being able to get up and get a drink or rush to a project meeting, without stressing about tripping over a cord or ripping the USB out is hard to beat. Hope this review helps, if you have any questions about the headset let me know and I'd be happy to answer them for you."
open-ended,B003VANOFY,12-Dec-13,1386835200,"Anyone use these with Google talk? If so, how's the microphone quality? I get tired of people saying what? can't hear you. Noisy/scratchy background, etc. I would like to make works call on them.",,"Sound quality is quiet good, especially for a headset. You can get stand alone microphones with better quality but for a headset the microphone is quiet good. I don't get any background noise, NO scratching or hum. I use it quiet often for gaming and Skype calls, works perfectly. The ""G-Keys"" allow you to assign a push to talk or any sort of macro keys. Let me know if you have any other questions. Please give me feedback, thanks!"

yes/no,B003VANOFY,25-Nov-13,1385366400,I've seen a lot of connectivity issues with this headset. Does it have the ability to function plugged in as if it is not wireless?,?,"The cable that plug into the headset serves only as a charging cable. The end of the cable is also marked with a battery icon. Removing the USB wireless receiver from the dock also disconnects the headset even when the headset is plugged in via the cable. This headset sends and receives audio over a wireless connection, so NO IT DOES NOT. The other answers are talking about the charging cable. I've been using my G930's for just under six months and haven't experienced connectivity issues not caused by myself. I've knocked the dock off my desk and it disconnected momentarily though immediately reconnected. disconnecting and reconnecting the USB receiver reconnects just a quickly (unless the driver crashes. You can manage to restart the G930 software and it will fix the issue though it isn't always your friend.). Issues might occur if one plugs the receiver into the back of their computer. I have my receiver in the dock on top of my desk. I greatly recommend this headset."

If these are plugged into a USB port for the wireless... is there a point in spending $60 on a 7.1 Soundblaster?,,"Nope there's no point in paying 60 bucks on a 7.1 soundcard in tandem, unless you also want to have a surround speaker setup. You are correct John, all audio is processed by the G930's soundcard including the simulated 7.1. While using the headset all other audio hardware in your system will be ignored."

open-ended,B003ZJ1VD8,3-Mar-11,1299139200,"How would this compare to other mechanical keyboards? So, out of these, which do you guys recommend?",,"I agree with Duc. All the latest mechanical keyboards use the same switches from Cherry, so they're give the same basic feel. In terms of price, the Razer keyboards, which use Cherry MX Blue switches seem the best and combined with the macro software is a rather great choice. I have two Filco Majestouch keyboards, one with Cherry MX Brown (tactile, but not clicky) and one with Cherry MX Blue (tactile + clicky) switches. In my opinion, I feel that the Cherry MX Brown switches are better for typing, but they're easier to fat finger, Blues are better for gaming as it's harder to mistype a key. The only thing is Cherry MX Brown switches are harder to come by in the US, but both Filco, which are now purchasable on Amazon via a merchant and the Das S Silent utilize said switches."
open-ended,B003ZJ1VD8,24-Mar-14,1395644400,what color is the switches?,,"Supposively they are Cherry blues, but they fail so often in this keyboard that I'm not convinced this information is true. Had three of them, all three had their switches fail after about a month. I have three other keyboards with Cherry switches and none of them has that problem."
open-ended,B003ZJ1VD8,24-Apr-13,1366786800,What colour is the back light?,,"The only back light there is on this keyboard is the Razor logo. It's only Blue, but you can turn it off, make it pulsate on and off or just have it in a solid state."

yes/no,B003ZJ5B4I,4-Oct-11,1317711600,Is the keyboard limited to light blue as its only back-lit color?,?,"Standard Blackwidow Ultimate has only blue with five intensity levels. There are other versions that give other colors (Dragon Age 2 with red and Battlefield 3 with orange), but each keyboard can only give one color at a time."

open-ended,B003ZJ5B4I,18-Jan-11,1295337600,spacebar issues? Letter R? Glossy? Does your space bar work?,,"The space bar issue is one that can occur to the space, shift, keypad +, keypad enter and keypad insert keys. The problem is that underneath said keys there is a thin rod running across with 2 little plastic parts holding the rod onto the key itself. This supports the wider key size, but when one of the little plastic parts pops out of the underside of the key, it will block the keys downward motion and will not allow the key to depress evenly, as the rod is only attached on one side. You will hear a rattle if you give it a shake. Pay shipping costs and wait for Razer to click the key back onto its rod then send it back, or just do it yourself... The issue is bound to happen some day- I hope this will be of some use to someone."

Even if you know what you are doing, plan on a full day of prep before you want to play. In theory you could install and play in the same day, but I find my enjoyment is much greater if I wake up and can go play without having to deal with steam and sega. Plus these games are just ok anyways. I recommend TW Medieval Kingdoms--you dont need steam and it has the best mod of any TW game: Third Age. In my opinion that mod is the peak of the Total War gaming experience. I think this once great franchise was ruined by greed and the need of some people to control others. Cheers."

I use it on Linux and it's still highly configurable there with only third-party software controlling it! If you're using this on Windows or Mac then the software is extremely configurable, allowing you to write settings that get stored into the mouse itself (there is a small bit of writable memory where they store it), and even create multiple profiles that you can easily switch between. For example, you can configure a profile for regular desktop use that isn't too sensitive, another profile that is much more sensitive for FPS gaming, and so on.

Hold it down until the ring of LED's blink around the controller's guide button, then press the corresponding ))) button on the console (round on the original and Elite models, and a small rectangle right up against the front USB ports cover) so that it also has it's LED ring blinking around the power button.

All you need is drivers which comes along with it just install it and you are good to go with most of the PC gaming !! the name itself might be cofusing as controller shape and style is same as native xbox360 controller but it has nothing to do with xbox360 box, yes you can use it on your xbox360 i guess !!! but if wish to use it for PC games, just installed the drivers and wireless USB, put some batteries and you are good to go!!"
yes/no,B004QRKWKQ,24-Apr-14,1398322800,"Does this work with emulators like ZSNES, ePSXe, and such?",Y,It should since it acts as a native DirectInput device. I know it works in PCSX2.

open-ended,B004QRKWLA,24-Jul-14,1406185200,How much Dorito dust will this hold until it is non-functional?,,"The more Dorito dust you cake onto this thing, especially around the analog sticks, the better you will become at Call of Duty. Also you should rinse it off with room temperature, flat Mountain Dew, but only the Gamer Fuel variety."
open-ended,B004QRKWLA,30-Aug-14,1409382000,How long is the cord?,,"The official length, according to Microsoft, is 9 feet. See: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/controllers/xbox360controller But mine is actually 10 feet, but that include the USB break-away dongle that is on the end. The dongle itself adds 1 foot."
yes/no,B004QRKWLA,21-May-14,1400655600,does it work with steam games?,?,"It does NOT work or work well with DirectInput (older, legacy, pre-2006) games, only works with XInput games. Before 2006, all PC games used DirectInput API standard for game controllers. Then in 2005, Microsoft implemented the XInput API for Xbox 360, and Windows had to follow and adopted the new Xbox 360 standard. However, the transition process for Windows has been long and gradual: some Windows games from 2013 still used DirectInput, (e.g., BioShock Infinite.) The Xbox 360 controllers do NOT have built-in functionality to work with games that use DirectInput. Sometimes the controllers may work but poorly: the controls are erratic, only partially functional, and/or either too sensitive or insensitive. I found out about the DirectInput vs. XInput problem only after I had tried to use an Xbox 360 Controller to play BioWare's Jade Empire: Special Edition, which was released in 2007 on the PC. Jade Empire used DirectInput. The controller worked only partially: the left joystick (that controls movement) was moving by itself so my game character could not stand still; the right joystick (that controls camera view) and D-pad (for abilities) were non-functional. I went online to look for solutions, and learned about the different DirectInput and XInput API standards. That was when I found a long list of PC games, mostly older titles, that do NOT work or work well with the Xbox 360 controller. The solutions I found were either very technical and difficult to implement, and/or was an additional cost, (e.g., buying a gamepad emulation or profiler app, which usually costs around $10; none of the free ones work well -- I tried;) and/or was inconvenient to use, (e.g., every time I reloaded Jade Empire, I had to unplug and replug in the controller connection for a gamepad profiler to continue to work.) They are just hassles. The problem with Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, which none of the other reviewers/fanboys has even bothered to mention, is that it does NOT have a built-in function to work with DirectInput. It may work, but it certainly does not work well or perfectly. The Logitech F310, for example, has a physical switch behind between ""D"" (DirectInput) and ""X"" (XInput) methods. The switch should stay on ""X"" most of the time. However, if you ever run into a DirectInput game, you just switch over to ""D"". The Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller does NOT have that switch. Microsoft wants developers and users to conform: everyone should stop using DirectInput and adopt XInput, so Microsoft would tell you to ""just don't play that game"" instead of giving users a real solution. (That's that answer other people got when they called Microsoft to try to get a solution for the DirectInput problem.) If you know you will definitely NEVER touch an old, pre-2006 game that works better with a gamepad or run into one of the odd new games that still uses the old API standard, then this controller may work for you. However, if you do run into a game that uses DirectInput, it will be a lot of frustration and hassle."
yes/no,B004QRKWLA,15-Mar-14,1394866800,"Although this controller is meant for the pc, can it still be used for the console as well?",Y,Yes actually. My friend had his xbox 360 and one controller and I put in mine and worked perfectly.
open-ended,B004QRKWLA,22-Oct-13,1382425200,Do I need to calibrate or download programs and are the programs included?,,"No, drivers were instantly downloaded when I plugged the device in, and once automatically configured, the device worked perfectly with all programs."
open-ended,B004QRKWLA,30-Apr-14,1398841200,"Hi, those any one know if it will work with Mac computer?",,"I can confirm it works with OSX 10.9 using the ""tattiebogle"" drivers. Feels just as responsive as when playing on the 360."

yes/no,B004QRKWLA,27-Aug-14,1409122800,Does this controller work for Minecraft.

yes/no,B004QRKWLA,18-Jul-14,1405666800,Can I use this controller in the place of a mouse and keyboard on SIM type games?,N,"I do not believe so, unless the game has controller support, the analog sticks do not take the place or act as a mouse in any situation.

However at this point it is not likely to get there by Christmas anyway, the post office has been moving slowly and I do not ship via overnight shipping methods. If you live within a state of Georgia there is a better chance it may get there before Christmas. Anyhow, that is the best I can do for you and I hope that answers your question. I need at least 30 minutes to pack it up and get there and it's 4pm here right now. Post office closes at 5."

Is it suitable for her age? also will i have to purchase additional cartridges or something?,,"This is a suitable gift for children. It has parental controls so you can limit what she does, such as browsing the Internet. 3ds Internet has Safe Browsing enabled. You can buy games online, or buy the cartridges. I would suggest buying games online, so your child doesn't accidentally lose or damage their game. The cartridges are a bit small and easy to lose track of if not taken care of. Also if you lose your stylus, you can order new ones for cheap. Those are also easy to lose."
open-ended,B0050SX7BQ,22-Nov-14,1416643200,"How is this compared to The Last of Us, can you give me a short description of what I can expect from the gameplay? Guns? 1st or 3rd person shooting?",,This game is basically completely different than The Last of Us. Beyond Two Souls was made by the same company who made Heavy Rain. It's heavily story based and you follow a plot through cut scenes and situations where you can decide how to interact with the environment. You do not fight monsters or enemies except in scripted fight scenes where you select the right buttons to use. You don't have weapons either. This isn't a shooter game its an interactive drama action-adventure video game also called a movie game. Basically you play a movie.

open-ended,B0050SX7BQ,22-Aug-14,1408690800,Are there actually puzzles in the game - and are they good?,,"The term ""puzzle"" for this game I think is used a bit loosely. There are questions you will develope while playing the game because something seems amiss or just not entirely clear, but are answered as you progress. When they say ""puzzle"" it's probably more along the lines of ""how do I want to define my character?"". The choices you make during the game, whether verbally or physically, will alter the story and relationships later on. Example: a scene where people are mean/abusive to you. You can choose to seek revenge or let it go. I'm not sure if you remember these, but there were ""choose your own adventure"" storybooks. You were given a scenario and each choice you made had a different outcome."

open-ended,B0050SX9I2,25-Mar-15,1427266800,Hi is this able to control the in app Netflix volume?,,"Not sure. I wasn't aware that there was in app volume control for Netflix. I have programmed the control to my T.V., so I just adjust the volume on my T.V. as needed. The control has all of the buttons your PS3 control has and then some to do things such as slow motion or bookmarks, ect. in one touch of a button. However it does not have the joysticks but it does have the ""R3"" and ""L3"" buttons. It also can be programmed to your amp as well. You can also change the audio and subtitle settings at the touch of a button. I hope this helps."

open-ended,B0050SX9I2,1-Feb-15,1422777600,Compatible with optima projector on the TV button ?,,I would say most likely not. In the instructions you are supplied tv codes to program remote. There's a scan option to find the code for the but I highly doubt that'd work with a projector.

Have you ever tried any NFS games? Because I think you might want to reconsider on this one. I've tried it before and the steering response is a little late and challenging. I'm just saying.

yes/no,B0050SYX8W,12-May-14,1399878000,Can you jump into Halo 4 not having played the other games?,?,Absolutely. I recommend that you play the story mode of Halo 4 first because this will help you become familiar with the controls. It will also introduce you to all of the weapons and vehicles
open-ended,B0050SYX8W,30-May-14,1401433200,"All right i'll admit it, i'm a bit challenged when it comes to some of these things. My question is-if i buy this halo 4 x box game will my grandson be able to play this on his i pod?",,"No, sir. That would prove impossible. Halo is available only for Microsoft XBOX 360. I would vote to have it on my iPad, though I'd guess Microsoft would have a fit if their competitor were to posses their precious game. Hope this helps!"

yes/no,B0050SYX8W,18-Mar-15,1426662000,Is there realistic blood-gore?,?,"I don't remember it being gory. I play (try) the horror games that are really gory and gross though. I think there is some blood but not major. Again, I haven't played it much and my daughter isn't too happy when I play with her because I always end up killing her. I think it should be rated T instead of M because it really isn't that bad from what I seen when I watch her play. My daughter is 20 now but she has had all of the Halo games. It is a shooter game, so there is violence and some blood...but I would not classify it as extreme as the COD games (Call of Duty). I just talked to my daughter and she said it's not gory."

yes/no,B0050SY77E,11-May-14,1399791600,Will I have to have played 1 &amp; 2 in order to follow the story?,?,I picked up the story after a few minutes. They pretty much flash back the entirety of the first two games. The story however isn't really that relevant to the game play.
open-ended,B0050SY77E,7-May-14,1399446000,How long is this campaign?,,"If you take the game seriously and don't run through it like an idiot then it should last you about 7 1/2 hours, by that i mean, using cover, scanning around, using some stealth, thats how much time i got"

No you don't need it because ea stopped that policy so that means any ea game is playable without a code.
yes/no,B0050SY77E,22-May-14,1400742000,Is Crysis 3 a co-op/multiplayer game?,?,Crysis 3 has a single player campaign and has multiplayer which you can battle others online.
yes/no,B0050SY77E,21-May-14,1400655600,is crysis 3 a multiplayer game?,?,Not the regular game. I am not sure if the XBox live version is. I do not have XBox live.
yes/no,B0050SY77E,13-Apr-14,1397372400,does this game have a multi player mode,Y,Yes it does just that the lobbies are pretty empty now. Not a lot of people play the multiplayer anymore but you can get lucky to meet a few players there. You can also arrange games with your friends who have the game too. Hope it helps.

open-ended,B0050SYK44,7-May-14,1399446000,Should I buy Borderlands 1 first or go straight to Borderlands 2?,,If you want to follow along the story lines and understand who the characters are in boardlands 2 then I would say yes. If you would like to just jump both feet into a game and start blazing away then no. If I had never played the first borderlands before playing the second it would be just as enjoyable.
open-ended,B0050SYK44,6-Jan-15,1420531200,what is the best person to use in the borderlands 2 game?,,"They all have their strengths, it really comes down to how you want to play and who you think looks the coolest. Do you want to start as the quick elemental sorceress, the robot assassin, the jacked and crazy bezerker, or the more standard, but very adaptable soldier? And, each one allows a good amount of playstyle customization as you go. That's not even bringing up the downloadable mechromancer and psycho... Or you can just start one of each and try them all out!"
yes/no,B0050SYK44,25-Jan-15,1422172800,Can I use this game with the game of the year edition add on content? Thanks.,?,"I'm not quite sure, since i haven't purchased any if its DLCs, but gamerfaq.com might be of assistance. Hope it helps!"

How do PS3 and Xbox compare?,,"Well I never had a PS3 before but from my experience with friends and other people the Xbox is better. While the ps4 is good, the Xbox is better then the PS3. I am not 100% sure on what makes the PS3 better or worse then Xbox, but if you Are asking my opinion, buy the Xbox."
open-ended,B0050SYK44,14-Nov-14,1415952000,Do you have to hook this up to play it online or can you just get the updates and play offline?,,"If you want the updates then you have to hook it in. But there really isn't updates at this point. There is one update as soon as you play to play online, I am pretty sure you need to be online. But playing online is5 really that different then offline, the only difference is obviously more players, but the enemies get stronger."

yes/no,B0051U7BZG,10-Jan-14,1389340800,Is this battery compatible with a PSP 2001?,Y,"It will work but it is only 1000 mA. That is smaller than the 1800 mA they came with your system. Almost all the replacement batteries are 1800 mAh. This will only hold a charge about half as long as the battery that came with your system. It will work, but you will probably regret paying twice as much for half the battery. Like I do."
open-ended,B0051U7BZG,18-Dec-13,1387353600,compat w 3001?,,Yes. This battery works in 2000 and 3000 series PSP's. The Lenmar battery is also the one I would recommend. It has been very reliable and was also pretty cheap. Also be sure to update the OS to the final release (version 6.60) especially if you decide to jailbreak your PSP. That way you won't need a pandora battery to install nploader or whatever alternate os you decide to use.

I did drain it fully the first time after I charged it fully - and it took over 2 hours to drain, but I only turned off all power save features, and was not using any network. My complaint with the battery is that it drains when NOT in use. So, I have it fully charged, and then 2 weeks later it is completely dead. It does charge up again ok. The reason I purchased this one is that the battery has a 1 yr warranty."
yes/no,B0051UMYLW,26-Aug-13,1377500400,Does this collection run on Windows 8?,?,"I do not use Win 8 as of yet. From what I have heard there is a compatibility issue trying to run it on Win 8. However you could download and install ""VMWARE player"" and if you have a copy of Winxp, you can install it after installing VMWARE. It is a pretty cool program. I have tested it out and was quite impressed by it. You may have to buy the program though once your trial period ends."
open-ended,B0051UMYLW,12-Apr-12,1334214000,DRM-Free? Are the games in this compilation DRM-Free?,,Good Question something I'd like to know as well.

The USB connection on the charging unit is also the same cable you move to your Mamba to put it in wired mode.
open-ended,B0054JGGGY,13-Jul-14,1405234800,How is the mamba's tracking while wired? I don't intend to use the wireless at all. I currently use a 3500 Deathadder,,The Mamba works great while hard wired. I owned a Death Adder prior to the Mamba and performance is identical. The only difference is that the Mamba has two extra buttons and a little more weight.
open-ended,B0054JGGGY,7-Feb-15,1423296000,What is the difference between this version and the mamba elite?,,Better battery life on the elite and RGB lighting. That also claim better wireless.

yes/no,B0054JGGGY,9-Apr-14,1397026800,Does it work with a MAC computer,Y,"It does, But I very strongly recommend against the purchase of this mouse or any Razer product for that matter. The software necessary to use this mouse properly is terrible, constant crashes and extremely slow. The mouse hardware is constrcued quite poorly. It feels cheaply made. After I have owned it for just over a year I have had consistent issues with the device. Razer's support hasn't been any help and frankly neglected my issues with the device."

I sit there watching something and the room randomly gets much brighter or dimmer. is something wrong with the glasses?,?,"When the infrared sensors do not receive a signal from the TV the glasses shut down, and the room is brighter. When they are receiving the signal the room is dimmer. Solution: sit a bit closer to the emitter on the TV."

Any suggestions?,,"I do not have the Epson 5020, but from what I have read, the Epson 5020 uses RF glasses whereas the PS3 glasses are IR (infra-red). So they would not be compatible.

I don't enjoy playing split screen too much because of having to share the tv, but I think that this will help a lot with that. Because I don't have a 3d tv, I also feel like it would be something new and fun to me. I never enjoyed shutter glasses but these look much more comfortable than what is on the market right now. Overall, I wish I could choose a game other than resistance cause I already preordered it, or even just get the tv by itself, but besides this it is a very cool piece of technology that I can hopefully get."

But to answer your main question Xbox live is Xbox Gold they are one and the same you pay $9.99 per month and that is it not twice and not for any separate service.
open-ended,B00576U8CC,4-Jan-15,1420358400,Why does it take long for Defiance game to download when you start the game?,,"If I'm remembering right, it's because the game is being updated from a server not related to Microsoft, and that server has (at least had) very limited bandwidth; also be prepared for the actual gameplay to be as slow and stuttering as the download."

So I'm pretty sure they do. They are not wireless. And the biggest drawback to tho headset is that the cable that connects from the headset itself to the volume controller is only about 2 1/2 feet long, but the cables from the volume controller to the ends where they plug up are about 10 feet long. They hook up via RCA connection and a USB power supply. I do believe there is a wireless version to these that costs a little more."

yes/no,B0057WDBHA,2-Aug-14,1406962800,Am I able to upgrade the joystick? It's a little wobbly and I prefer it to be a bit tighter. Personal preference.,Y,"Hi Will, I know of two methods to tighten the joystick on the V3 without upgrading the joystick or replacing parts. Hopefully one of these two methods will solve your problem (you can even do both). They both start the same way so let's begin. 1. Remove the seven screws on the back of the arcade stick (not the four holding the rubber feet on) to open up the controller. 2. Unscrew and remove the square gate (white plastic piece directly beneath the joystick) - Here is where the two methods differ. I have tried both but the easier one (which worked well for me) I will write first. Method 1: Electrical Tape This is an easier sort of quick fix that's guaranteed to reduce the wiggle room in your joystick. 3. Move the four black pieces (exposed after taking the square gate off) away from the white cylinder piece in the middle. *Remember the orientation of these four pieces for when you put it back together* 4. Wrap around the white cylinder with electrical tape. I believe any tape would do, electrical tape is just a precaution. 5. Test the tightness of the stick by screwing the four black pieces back down and playing with the stick. Add more tape as needed. 6. Reverse every step all the way back to one to put the stick back together. Method 2: Tightening the Spring This one would be just as easy as putting tape on if it wasn't for removing the c shaped clamp. You'll see once you try (or maybe I just suck, lol). One of the videos at the bottom shows how to take the clamp off. 3. On top of the white cylindrical piece there is a screw and a metal c shaped clamp. Remove the c shaped clamp. 4. This cylinder should come apart, dislodging the joystick and exposing a spring. Stretch the spring (the longer the spring, the tighter the joystick). 5. If you are comfortable taking off and putting on the metal c clamp, feel free to test out the joystick and adjust the spring to your liking. (This was very difficult for me on my V3 which is why I went with method #1 even though this method seems more professional.) 6. Put the stick back together by reversing every step back to step one. Here are some videos to help if I was confusing or left out details. Removing the square gate on a V3: youtube.com/watch?v=zNOE95P4lYY start at 0:00 and stop at 1:30, the rest isn't important for what you're doing Using Method 2 to tighten the spring: youtube.com/watch?v=4K2ONYAapOQ start at 2:26 and stop at 4:30, again the rest isn't important Contact me if you have any questions."

yes/no,B0057WDE8Q,12-Apr-15,1428822000,How easy is it to put custom artwork on this? Can't seem to find any tutorials for it,?,"Difficult. The reason being is because in order to get artwork on properly, you would want to remove the buttons. In order to do so though, you would need to desolder the buttons because this stick does not have quick disconnects. Best option would be to look into possibly getting a laminated label that it sticky at the bottom but those usually aren't great"

open-ended,B0057WDE8Q,30-Apr-14,1398841200,How easy is it to mod with sanwa parts?,,"Well, I heard that the buttons are soldered onto the stick and that it would be moderately difficult to mod when you have the correct tools, such as a soldering iron."

Is that true?,,No. This is made up of very sturdy plastic. The construction is solid and I believe it will last a very long time. The metallic part that you see is thin cover over the top center part of the rudder used as a cosmetic enhancement.

As far as functionality I doubt if there is any difference but I can't say for sure. The Pro Flight Pedals look to have more adjustments.

Which one should I buy for xPlane 10?,,"They will work with XPlane 10 (PC/Mac) the only real difference is the pedals in this model are fashioned and licensed by Cessna. If you're never going to fly a real Cessna (150/172/182) then there's no reason to go for these if the others are cheaper, the licensing is what brings up the price. They are essentially the same thing. I bought them to have the same 'feel' as when I went flying. but other than that there's no real reason not to go with the other Saitek brand pedals (if it's the ones I am thinking of)."

open-ended,B005UDTTS6,8-Aug-14,1407481200,"Does the Matrix of Leadership ever make an appearance, or is it only mentioned in the game?",,"It's only mentioned. Unlike the first game where the Matrix changes hands into Optimus' for the first time; this game focuses on the actual Fall of their home planet. Optimus stays the Prime and despite not hearing anything about a third game there could easily be one if they feel the need to make it. If your an old fan it will please you with how they molded the story, if a new fan you will love it the same. The biggest suggestion to make for anyone is to search the levels, find the 'Easter Eggs', collectables and just general background details that give a boatload of extra depth to both game stories."

There is not any cussing and the violence is no more than they would see in ""Transformers The Movie"", which is carried out in a cartoonish manner with swords and gadgets. Now if they play online that is a different story but even online everyone tends to be respectful because majority of the players are children."
open-ended,B005UI8V6C,24-Aug-13,1377327600,How do you get all three games to download only the Traitor Soul will download?,,"The other games aren't separate downloads. Just open Traitor Soul, make your character etc.., and then once you start playing you will start out in the Temple of Fate and have the option to go to the town of Grove (Game 1), the outpost of Druantia (Game 2), or the Outpost of Typhon. Unfortunately the Town of Grove isn't exactly like the original Fate (you'll notice the differences in monsters, your pet, merchandise, etc..) which irked me at first, but once you get used to them they're pretty neat."

open-ended,B005UI8V6C,28-Feb-15,1425110400,So I've owned this game for a month and it was working fine until one day it just refused to finish loading and won't work anymore. Any Ideas?,,"Jonathon, if you know right about when it stopped working, I would run a System Restore back to just before that, maybe a couple of days if there's an entry for that time. It will uninstall programs installed since then, and will also uninstall Windows updates, and I'm pretty sure it takes care of Java updates, if you have that installed (most people do). It won't affect your documents or internet favorites or anything like that. If that doesn't make the game load correctly, I would uninstall and reinstall the game. You can locate your game save folder, and copy the whole thing to your desktop or Documents or whatever. For Windows XP, it's in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE, or for Vista and 7: C:\Program Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE. These folders will be hidden, so you'll have to set the Explorer window to show hidden and system files. I would just copy the whole SAVE folder, uninstall and reinstall the game, and then start a new game just to make sure the folders get reestablished to start with. Then copy your old SAVE folder onto the new one. I did this moving the game from one computer to another, and it worked fine."

Because the hard drive for that console attaches to the top and doesn't have an internal hard drive slot. But the 2nd and 3rd model 360s do because they have internal hard drive slots.

I had thankfully made a backup on my pc 3 months before with Xport 360. So you're saying evrything was moved from the original drive to the new one over the cable but the data wasn't there when you started the 360 with the new drive? Or did Xbox Live apply an update and the data was erased after the update? It might still be there and recoverable, just unrecognized by the 360. First do not pit more stuff on the drive! It increases the chance of any data there previously being overwritten or becoming fragmented! Best to not even turn the 360 on with the drive in. Try using fatx explorer, as it actually has a recovery tool for deleted files. If the 360 redormatted the drive entirely though, your data is gone, as formatting deletes the data and overwrites it with a blank slate."

Except it will not play original xbox games. Not a problem for me. It is not uncommon that defective units slip through quality control and my guess is that you might have one. I suggest return it for exchange because Amazon has excellent customer service. I hope this was helpful. It should already be formatted and ready to go. Good luck. Thanks for asking.

open-ended,B0065NP6NC,18-Dec-14,1418889600,how different is this from fallout 3? I never completed FO3 but enjoyed the atmosphere and the idea that it starts you as a child.,,"FONV is similar to FO3 in concept. FONV is different in that it dumps you right into the action with more creatures and gangs. As with FO3 it has several DLCs too. The graphics are slightly improved. Of course the setting is pretty cool. Please do finish FO3, good fun."

open-ended,B006IR6NH8,4-Dec-14,1417680000,How does this thing steer? does it attach to something or does it use an accelerometer? and will it work with most racing games?,,"It uses an accelerometer, but I've seen setups where people attached it to the column of other steering wheels. The accelerometer is alright, in my opinion. It's not a high end wheel since no feedback, but it's nicer to use than a gamepad, or worse, mouse and keyboard. As for games, I tried it out with F1 2013, F1 2014, TDU2, Race 07, GTR Evolution, and DiRT 3, and they all worked fine after setting the controls to what I wanted."

open-ended,B006IR6NH8,14-Mar-15,1426316400,Does this wheel need to be attached to some other unit? Or is what is advertised here all that is needed?,,"It works with accelerometers, so you don't need to attach it to anything at all, unless you want to."

But I would recommend you to launch BootCam and run this wheel on Windows natively, if you can."
open-ended,B006IR6NH8,23-Jan-14,1390464000,"Does it work with any driving or racing game, even simulators?",,"Yes, I have used with iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Need for Speed Shift 2, and Game Stockcar 2013. It works well but without FFB (force feedback). By comparison, in iRacing, I tend to be about 1-2 seconds slower per lap than I am with my Fanatec ClubSport Wheel and Pedals. However, I am certain that I could close that gap to less than 1 second with more practice."

yes/no,B006JKARP8,26-May-14,1401087600,Will this work with the new vita to be released on may 6th?,?,"It will charge the Vita 2000, however you will need the USB cable from the original Vita 1000 kit to charge the battery. You should be able to buy the original Vita USB cable separately here on Amazon."

yes/no,B006JKARP8,27-Jan-15,1422345600,Can this be used to charge other devices via USB?,Y,absolutely! Just check The needed voltage and the charger's maximum. But it will work with almost everything

However, I bought the PC version and waited a few days for it to ship to me. The CD key from the physical PC version will unlock the game on Steam for digital download. You should then have permanent access to it on Steam forever. Basically, if you can wait a few days definitely order the PC version and save some bones."

open-ended,B006LVZEN0,10-Apr-12,1334041200,"How many ""REAL"" buttons? How many buttons from this will register in my other games without using a different program?",,"Windows will only recognize 5 buttons. The others you'd have to program in the mouse software to duplicate keyboard keys, like F1 to F12. This is true for all the mmo mice with lots of buttons. In addition, you can program macros to each button. For example, you could program one of the mmo7 buttons to simultaneously click on the target and activate a keypress like F12 (then bind ""grenade throw"" to F12 in the game), and voila, you have a mouse-over-target single-click grenade throw. Again, you can do the same thing with most high-end gaming/mmo mice."
yes/no,B006LVZEN0,14-Feb-13,1360828800,Does it have on-board memory for the profiles? I currently have a G700 and this feature has almost become a requirement for me (Plug 'N Play).,?,"No it doesn't. I just put everything on a USB drive, drivers, profile editor and profiles. A little more of an inconvenience but for me having a mouse fully adjusted and customized to my hand makes up for it."
open-ended,B006LVZEN0,17-Sep-13,1379401200,Are the measurements listed for the mouse or mouse package?,,"There isn't any measurements as far as I can tell, but it does make sense because this mouse is fully customization. It can be very small once everything is retracted, or can be longer when fully extended. It can fit pretty much the average person's hand. People that would have a hard time would be someone who's 6'0 + and have huge hands."
open-ended,B006LVZEN0,29-Feb-12,1330502400,"Is the MMO 7 good for FPS/graphic design? I love buttons, but are they freely customizable?",,all mouse buttons are configurable to any keystroke.
open-ended,B006LVZEN0,26-Dec-13,1388044800,There doesn't seem to be an option to map mouse keys to launch software? The profile configuration only allows macros and pre-determined hotkeys.,,"The mouse macro options in the software should allow you to program the buttons to activate keyboard keys, repeat recorded mouse actions, and mouse buttons. To open software, you could record presses involving the windows key, but it cannot natively open software."
open-ended,B006LVZEN0,5-Mar-14,1394006400,It looks like there is a giant screw sticking out the bottom of the mouse that would jam into my wrist if I tried to palm the mouse. Why doesn't it?,,"due to the way your hand wraps around the mouse, even at rest it never touches it. FYI, that screw is actually the modification tool for the mouse. All of the removable pieces have a hex screw keyed to that same tool, so you can easily change the plates. The palm rest has a small lever on the right side just underneath the shell that when pressed in, allows you to slide that entire plate forward or back so you can find a comfortable setting for your hand. Setting this plate correctly for your hand will also keep you from hitting the tool when its in the mouse."
open-ended,B006LVZEN0,13-Aug-14,1407913200,Does the scroll wheel retain its inertia or click into place (i.e. behave like a flywheel or like the wheel from Wheel of Fortune)?,,"To put it in the context you suggested, ""Wheel of Fortune"". It does not retain any real inertia, and basically only moves when you have your finger on it."
yes/no,B006LVZEN0,25-Jan-15,1422172800,Is it good for Large and Wide hands?,Y,"yess, it has a plate that you can put on the right side that you can rest all your fingers on, and the pam rest goes out almost liek 2 and a half inches max, but there is also a 2ndary palm rest that is higher up that will fit even larger hands"
yes/no,B006LVZEN0,25-Jan-15,1422172800,Does it light up at all?,?,"only the dpi indicator, the mode changing button and the front of the main mouse buttons light up,but there is a gap infron of the buttons, so when the mouse is resting, it looks like a cross of light is projected infront of the mouse on whatever the mouse is resting on"
yes/no,B006LVZEN0,15-Apr-15,1429081200,"have you been satisfied with this mouse so far, does it hold up?",Y,Mouse holds up just fine. I love all the features and the way onlookers ogle over the mouse. I like the weight of the mouse and it's flexibility. I would suggest however if you have large hands to keep looking. This particular mouse almost fits my hand and I find myself holding it in odd positions that make my hand cramp up after long use. Overall I would give it four and a half out of five stars. Hope this helps.

open-ended,B006RJ373K,14-Feb-15,1423900800,Do all switches and buttons work properly and do what they are supposed to?,,"Your question is too general for a simple ""Yes/No"" answer. I assume you are referring to the buttons and switches in the cockpit simulations? Firstly, it depends upon which aircraft simulation you are using - some of them, like the Cessna 172 are well-supported, and others have less complete support. Most of the commercially available plane simulations for X-Plane have very well-equipped simulations Then, what do you mean ""do what they are supposed to do"". Switches for flaps, and turning on an off lights etc normally are pretty realistic. Some of the more complex GPS navigational equipment is not 100% identical in function to the equipment in the real aircraft, but most normal users are unlikely to be affected by that. Most radio navigational equipment works as expected. Generally X-Plane cockpit simulations are pretty good."

So yes you can use it, but you are tethereed to the controller and you need to purchase an adapter. The only 100 percent wireless headset on the market for the Xbox One is the Stealth 500X."

open-ended,B006W41W3M,1-Dec-14,1417420800,Is this true surround or virtual surround?,,"This is a juicy question. All headset surround sound is 'virtual' -- digital signal processing is used to give you a surround sound experience. I won't get into the math. That said, it is extremely effective, more so than having a typical home theater set-up with multiple speakers. Because your left ear only hears the left channel, and the right ear only hears the right channel, a headset can deliver a really immersive and accurate surround sound signal. There are people who will argue all day long that you need to have multiple speakers in a headset for 'true' surround sound, but actually sticking a bunch of speakers in a small space like that is more likely to create audio chaos than quality surround sound. Trust me on this, I work at a headset company. I wear them when I play and the quality of the surround is amazing. You can also read reviews of our headsets ... the writers all say the same."

How can you share reviews between products (mice in this case) that have entirely different layouts and designs?,,"Exactly. Some things, like hard drives of the same make, model and series that just have different sizes... those I can see lumping together. But these Razer mice are NOT THE SAME PRODUCT at all. A review of one is not valid for a review of another one. Amazon failed big time combining these."

It has the perfect amount of buttons for how many item slots there are but with season 4 there is now 7 buttons 6 items and 1 trinket so this means you wont be ablr to have the whole bag resdy to go you might have to set some other macro up to use the 6th item slot because thetrinkret will use number 4 or 6 I csnt remember... long story short ya its good for lol ps I sent this on a phone after losing a ranked game at 1:30 AM so idc about sll the typos that this probably has!

yes/no,B006W3ZXEW,3-Aug-14,1407049200,is this wireless,?,"It is not wireless.

open-ended,B0071NH8B8,8-Jul-14,1404802800,How many hour's of gameplay will it last before the battery needs to be re-charged?,,"Depends on if you have the Wi-Fi on or off, if you have it on it's going to drain the battery. Say 3 hours or so? Without it 4 hours, but I believe you can shut off the system without powering it off completely to conserve power."
open-ended,B0071NH8B8,11-Feb-15,1423641600,what music formats does it play?,,mp3 mp4 wma. I'm sure it plays others but I haven't tried any other ones yet.

How well will this work for me?,,"I'm not sure how well this exact model will work for that since the mic is in the cord about 5-6"" down. I'd definitely recommend one of their headsets with the mic that positions in front of the mouth. I have a Turtle Beach PX22 at home that I use on Skype and it works very well. As far as the background noise goes that's going to be more with the software you use. In my experience Skype definitely picked up on the background noise from all parties in the calls."

Personally I never ran into this issue as the grip gives you that second charge for your vita :)
yes/no,B0079V29EI,19-Jun-14,1403161200,"Yes, I have the original vita model. If I have a Hori skin protector attached, will it still fit on the grip? Thanks!",Y,Yes it will fit. The Vita is placed into the Nyko grip at an angle (Top first and then bottom) and once it's resting in the grip there will be only a slight latch on the top and bottom to partially secure it. The main way the Vita is secured is by the locking mechanism on the bottom side at the charging port. The Hori should not ever be affected by what little this grip actually is touching on the Vita's face.

yes/no,B007FTE2VW,25-Oct-14,1414220400,Do you have to install with origin,Y,Yes because Sim city connects and is run by EA though u can go offline EA requires u to have and enter a key through origin

The other advantages of single player mode are that the space center work is not bugged and that the prices of the goods are steady and do not swing around. The one disadvantage is that you don't get achievements.

(You even still get Founder's status added to your account, heh. I bought it for the toon unlocks, and that plus the mount alone was worth it, let alone the other cool stuff in the box)"
open-ended,B007JDMPOK,4-Jan-15,1420358400,"Is it worth buying this when I already am playing for free? I have heard buying this gets you founder's status, but will i have to start over again?",,"No you will not have to start over again, this will just give you all the perks of being a founder with out paying out the nose. here is the financial bits from my previous review of this item. Once you play one character and type, you're going to want to eventually try them all not to mention open your bank slots (as you acquire a lot of stuff fairly quickly). This is what prompted me to buy a copy the game even though is now free to play. By doing the math I found that the EMP (cash shop dollars for the game) to dollar ratio is about 100:1 (100 points for every dollar) a single character slot is 495 EMP or 3960 EMP to unlock all 8, BUT only for one server! That's a little over $39. Then when you add in the cost of expanding your bank slots that's an additional 495 EMP for 1 slot or 1320 EMP for all 3, costing an additional $5-$13. So in the end you would end up paying between $54.45 - $52.80 just for upgrades on ONE server. So that in mind I decided to buy a physical copy, which will give me all 8 character slots & all 4 bank slots in all the servers not to mention 3 pages instead of 1 in the Brokerage (Player's Market), to save myself money in the long run. I also decided to spend an additional $15 and upgrade to the collectors edition simply to get all the nifty extras! The review by Catpsyche really says it all for why I did. But even then I still saved money! Also just some advice, but if you are going to buy something from the EMP shop save yourself money in the long run and always buy permanent!"

However, the code of goodies is tied to your online account with which you registered on Tera (eg. Mark@someemail.com). Hope this helps."
yes/no,B007JDMPOK,23-Jul-14,1406098800,Do I have to use the activation code to get the mounts? I was hoping they were seperate codes.,?,"The mounts are included in the activation code.

yes/no,B007JDMPOK,28-Apr-14,1398668400,Does this open up more than 2 character slots on a single server?,Y,"yes, it opens all of the available character slots, which I believe are 8 per server. I would suggest reading through the reviews below most of your questions could be answered, as there are a lot of very reliable reviews available. here is mine :http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N8XAQ5U81MC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm you'll also save a lot of money in the long run by buying a copy. but what is included in the CE when you enter the code (enter it both forwards then again backwards): The pack comes with: - Founder Title - 8 character slots (including the 2 given to you) - 4 Bank Slots - Tawny Lion - 2 Semi-Enigmatic Scrolls - 2 Emeralds - Lv 15 Necklace (Account Bound) - Lv 40 Necklace (Account Bound) - Warhorse Mount (Account Bound) - Frost Lion Mount (Account Bound)"

It seems like this system the slim, adds an extra step to the save and load process. to ask you WHERE you want to get the data, your 4 mg internal memory, your NEWly installed hard drive, or the cloud. I think that step interfers with the OLD xbox functionality, so they do not work. They mean the old xbox, NOT the xbox 360. so your 360 games should all work fine, I have tried like 12+ games, and they all worked. But I never tried a xbox game.

Not all original Xbox games are. If the hdd works then yes you should be able to but I would buy it at a game stop location to be on the safe side that way if it does not you can still return it fairly easily.

To be honest I bought this because it was cheap but for some reason I kept getting shocked by the controller.

And how it performs? It works for what it is, if agame supports an xbox 360 controller it will work. There might even be some mods or workaround a for games that don't support 360.

open-ended,B007LQG9A6,6 days ago,,This controller is working for racing games while it is not working for any action game and online game. But why?,,"could be a compatibility issue - most PC games with controller compatibility are set up to take on-brand xbox controllers, which have a particular kind of input. a lot of off-brand usb controllers have a different kind of input. since the game is set up to only recognize one kind of input, it wont recognize the off-brand controller as a controller at all. x360ce is a controller emulator program you can use to solve this problem. it switches the input so that the game recognizes the controller as a controller. i used it and it worked - you can find the program and tutorials on how to use it with google. it could also be because the controller isnt very good and just doesnt work."

Are you absolutely certain you are buying an 8GB solid state and not a 128GB solid state? 8GB does not hold a lot of data in 2014. If you are indeed purchasing a 128GB solid state then the OS would be loaded on the SSD for performance reasons. That would give you approximately 100GB of usable space for critical applications/games as best practice is keeping your SSD at a minimum of 20% free.

yes/no,B007SRM5MO,30-Dec-14,1419926400,"Is there much violence, blood, gore, shooting?",?,"I don't know why the top rated answer said yes. It's a Batman game - there is a small level of violence but it's very tame, showing no blood whatsoever. There is no blood or gore, and shooting is stopped by Batman's armor, and if you were asking if you play as someone who shoots people, Batman only has non-lethal weapons.

I make youtube videos (Gammby5874) and I have a review of this mouse which will help you in case you don't understand this: You can make different profiles/maps for different programs. You can make one for Autocad and bind the mouse to different keystrokes. Say there is a shortcut for something that uses ""P"" frequently, but that is always out of the way, you can make it so that one of the mouse buttons is that letter. OR you can make it a more advanced binding. Like I said I don't use that, but this mose is WAY more than just an MMO gaming mouse. It has tons of other functionalities."

If you wanted, you could, say, have the ""="" key on your keyboard press 1, 2, and 3 on the keyboard (You'd have to configure the macro in-game, if GW2 doesn't have macros, then you'll need a keyboard with programmable keys or a 3rd party program or something), then in Razer Synapse, you could make button 1-12 act as the ""-"" key, I believe."

I'm running 64 bit Windows Vista.",,"In regards to steam, it is functional if the game supports generic controllers. Many steam games when they say controller support, they only mean XBOX 360 controller support. So it really depends on the game. For instance I played rogue legacy with a sega saturn adapter and SS controller, and it worked great. The game Fez however had a number of problems regsitering other controllers than an xbox 360 one. As far as not registering, I couldn't say. I am running x64 windows 7 which in terms of driver support is usually identical, and I had no problems just plugging it in and having it detected as USB Genesis controller or something like that under devices and printers."

In ESO, you can do PvP (Player vs. Player), where you fight against real people and not just NPCs (or AI). You cannot do PvP in Skyrim. And, for ESO, you have to pay a subscription fee of $15/month on top of the MSRP $60 for the game to purchase. ESO is an MMO meaning it can potentially go forever, whereas Skyrim had an end!"

(Pros, Cons, Worth trying?, Worth Subscribing?, Good online encounters?, Fun for how long?)",,"Hi Nate, Yes ESO is most definitely worth trying. The community of players is very nice and friendly, so if you ever need help with something there will pretty much always be someone there to help you out. I think that once you play it for a few weeks you'll pretty much be ready to make the long term subscribe decision on your own. You need to set up subscription in order to play initially, but you get the first 30 days free regardless and you can cancel your sub before you get charged. The game, for me at least, was immensely fun and engaging for the first 2 months. Once you play through the main story line and go through each factions area, the engagement feeling drops off a bit. But at that point the game becomes less story based and almost strictly pvp based. The crafting and trade systems are wonderful and fun. My advice to any new players is to look for a trading guild the second you hit level 10. it will make your life much easier. The random encounters are fun when they happen, but i didn't see them happening too often, hopefully they will make them more frequent. tl;dr definitely try it, lots of initial fun, late game fun is an 'acquired taste'. Subscription worthy is only up to you."

Now if you are actually gonna use it for games on your mac, don't get it. Whenever I started a game (any game with the exception of Minecraft) with the mouse plugged in, my mac froze unless I was in bootcamp (windows 7).

Don't waste your money on this game... it's really not that good. The stick is not too bad yet not the best I've used. If you find really cheap then might be worth it.

The mouse's on board memory also allows these buttons to be changed via the software on one system, but the mouse itself will remember the changes so that you may plug and play on another system with your changed button layout."

It has a sort of matte paint feel, kind of like gamepads (xbox 360, ps3). On the right side of the mouse it is textured with a rubber material to help you keep your grip."
yes/no,B0086UK7I6,11-Apr-15,1428735600,Are the buttons fully programmable for things besides games? ie copy/paste ctrl+w etc,?,They are prgramable with the ability to do more then one button at a time so you could program Ctrl+c to copy as a button. Only problem I had was making the shift key function as a programble button such as Ctrl but you can program the shift functions and it works with shift key then.
yes/no,B0086UK7I6,9-Apr-15,1428562800,Does it have any clicking issues that happen to it?,N,"All of the buttons are amazingly responsive. The only issue I have with the mouse is that there's no place to rest your thumb other than a button, so when you ""white-knuckle"" the mouse during combat, you may unintentionally hit a thumb button. The thumb buttons are angled so you can easily identify without looking down which button your thumb is resting on. The Naga Razor doesn't have this feature. All the buttons on the Naga are flush, so you have to look to see where your thumb is."
open-ended,B0086UK7I6,7-Feb-15,1423296000,Can you use fingertip or claw grip with this mouse?,,"You can, but it's probably going to be a bit less effective than a grip that doesn't rely heavily on the thumb for movement. I have no idea how I played MMOs before this mouse. It even has massive utility for the FPS games I play. I would change my grip style to use it & never look back. :)"

open-ended,B0086UK7I6,11-Nov-13,1384156800,Why is the white mouse $20 more than the black mouse?,,"As far as I have been able to find out with light research, Logitech is probably trying to get more money for the same product just different color and call it a special. I doubt the cost is actually increased or any real reason beyond that. I personally wouldn't want a white mouse though, simply because black hides dirt and grime better. But a white mouse would probably prompt more frequent cleanings."

open-ended,B0086UK7IQ,23-Sep-13,1379919600,Anybody but me use gaming mice for non-game stuff?,,"Yes. I use it along with a G13 for AutoCAD at work. Having enter, esc, del, bksp, undo, redo, & other commands always available is a great addition. Honestly, I game at home, but I make better use of the G buttons with productivity software than I ever have in the games (not that I don't use them for those too). For repetitive, command intensive software, programmable keys are the way to go."
yes/no,B0086UK7IQ,29-Nov-13,1385712000,"Is this mouse ok for smaller hands? Mine are, and though it's hard to tell from the photos, it looks rather large...",?,Measuring the bottom it's 4x3. It doesn't seem much larger than the average mouse but it's higher. The side buttons are very small. I have medium size female hands and it's about perfect for me. Also it is very sensitive and for the top regular right/left click buttons you can press really far back on them and still have them work so it should be fine.
yes/no,B0086UK7IQ,2-Jun-14,1401692400,"Did they iron out the firmware on this mouse, eliminating the weird motion skipping it suffered from?",?,"If you have a G600 producted prior to Oct 2012 you will not be able to update the firmware on the mouse. You will be stuck with firmware 77.00.12. If you call Customer support, and have some time, they should be able to offer you a resolution. I battled with the spazzing and skipping of the mouse sicne I got i. I thought maybe it was my mouse pad, so I got a new mouse pad after cleanign the lens of the mouse. Still it continued. After i built a new rig, the sam e problem continuied to occur.

open-ended,B0086UK7IQ,28-Oct-13,1382943600,"Is it good for shooters? I really like it, but im not a big mmorpg player. So, is it good for shooters?",,It helps. Being able to switch weapons in a bind and using the g shift button to temporarily lower the sensitivity when sniping and instantly go back to normal sensitivity is nice. This is the best mouse I've ever used. Feels great works great and will last for a long time.
yes/no,B0086UK7IQ,24-Mar-14,1395644400,Are the buttons too close together for your thumb to accurately hit?

Is this mouse only suited for one style of grip preference or not?,,claw grip is problematic because it becomes too easy to press a thumb key. they really need a raised fix ridge or ridges running between rows of keys so you can grip something with your thumb without also pressing a key Personally using this and the razer naga has caused a RSI with my thumb specifically because of having to lock it in a weird position to just to keep from pressing a thumb key
yes/no,B0086UK7IQ,18-Mar-14,1395126000,Does this mouse work well with Macs?,?,I'm not sure; I bought this mouse for a Windows PC. It works great for Windows PC though.
yes/no,B0086V5UF0,7-Jun-14,1402124400,will this work in South America?,N,That depends on your gaming system. You might have to ask Nintendo. I thought all gaming systems were the same not like DVD players.

I did get a chance to do some of the video with the kids then. 2015 has a lot more of the newer songs and has a lot of new dance moves. With the three granddaughters it is important they keep up with all the latest moves. I am having a lot of fun learning with them. I am in a jazzercise class so these videos are a great help.

But if you really want to, uh, Just Dance... you can just stand behind the kids with remotes and dance along with them! My wife and I you got just as much benefit... And it's just as fun. True, you just don't get to keep track of your score or how perfect you matched the moves."

Do I need a remote controller for each of them or can they just follow the choreographer on the screen?,,You can have up to 4 girls dancing at one time. Yes you need a remote for each of them if you want to record their score and see who wins. If they just want to dance for fun then they can all dance by just following the person on screen. Either ways are fun. Hope I answered your question! Happy dancing!

The advice given on the back of the case re video card (presumably one in the same a grahphics card) is: Directx compatible or later with 512MB RAM AMD: ADA RADEON2600XT, 3650 5550, 6450 or higher per series NVIDIA GFORCE8600GT,9500GTGT150, GT1250"
open-ended,B0087OZ5FG,5-Aug-14,1407222000,These headphones work with PS4,,"Yes they do, and perfectly I must say! Just plug in the usb dongle into ps4 usb port and turn headphones on and your done, no setting it all up, microphone also picks up really good so people have no problem hearing you talking. There is also an app for ps4 called headset companion app and in that you can choose different sound modes and update the headset as needed. Even if these are more get these over the new PlayStation headphones the new ones are horrible, no bass! And with these elites you can actually plug anything with a headphone jack into the dongle and it will send the audio wirelessly to the headphones, I use them with my cell phone, tv, Xbox one and ps4 wirelessly. And you can also use them like a regular set of headphones with the cable if you need them but forgot to charge them."

yes/no,B0087OZ5FG,10-Sep-14,1410332400,A) Does software work with PS4. (Lower Mic Volume normally) B) How comforable are they?,?,"Most everything works on the PS4. The volume controls are a bit wonky but you'll get used to them in time. The software side doesn't work to lower chat volume and there is no ""your voice through speakers"" feature like Turtle Beach has. If you play a lot of multiplayer like I do, you'll find a sweet spot and leave it there. As for being comfy? They are quiet comfortable. Of course if you wear glasses you'll eventually get the geek headache from it squeezing them into your domepiece. Otherwise if you wear them without a hat or glasses on, they are comfortable. I've owned headsets from every brand on the market. Turtle Beach is alright but they break easily. Astro is by far too expensive and the company attitude/customer service is vomit worthy. Tritton is just... sad. Logitech and Corsair are awesome but console compatibility is an issue. This headset is actually well built and my favorite I've owned. It has some quirks but it makes up for it in ease of setup. Other headsets require a ton of unsightly cabling."
open-ended,B0087OZ5FG,13-Dec-14,1418457600,"When using with a PC, are you still getting 7.1 Surround sound? Or is 7.1 only work with Playstation 3/4?",,They arent true 7.1... It states virtual 7.1 stereo sound.
open-ended,B0087OZ5FG,2-Oct-14,1412233200,"Honestly, what headset should I buy? The Pulse Elite, or the Gold Wireless Headset?",,"If it's honesty you want then there's only one choice The Pulse Elite i have two sets now my Daughter and myself best headset I owned todate, so good my Daughter had me get a set for her. Too many options to list what can be done with them but you will be very pleased. One set is over a year old the other close to a year now..Have not had ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL... And we both game alot WOW, Neverwinter,Diablo3 also Sniper and star craft all work great no flaws at all. So there it is now it's up to you? and those are only a few games I've tried with them good luck.."
yes/no,B0087OZ5FG,20-Feb-15,1424419200,Does sidetone (hear your own voice) not work on PS4? Any help on the settings if it does.,?,"Yes you can. It has 3 settings Off, Low, High. I will say though on High it's still ""low"" and you can slightly hear your own voice. Not the best but the sound quality of the headphones makes up for the sidetone quality for me."
open-ended,B0087OZ5FG,28 days ago,,How's the wireless range on this thing compare to the gold version?,,"To be honest, I haven't used the gold headset and i havent been able to test the unobstructed range seeing as how I live in a small house. I do know for a fact that the gold has a better range and battery life seeing as how it's newer. BUUUT in MY opinion, the pulse elites are better because you can make anything with an aux out port wireless. They feel amazing. I had them charging and did a 24 hour game session and i had absolutely no discomfort (as far as the headset goes that is. They will reach through your average wall. I was listening to music from my ps3 in my bathroom that is about 15-20 feet away with to walls. Now I can't say for sure if you will get that kind of reach through the walls at your house or not but that isn't a really big deal. All around I would pick these over the gold anytime. Now don't get me wrong, they're both AMAZING headsets!!"
yes/no,B0087OZ5FG,20-Dec-14,1419062400,can you hear own voice,Y,"Yes, you can. It has sidetone. You have to hold the mute button down for two seconds to switch between low and high sidetone. The sidetone on high sounds very low though."
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,24-Jan-14,1390550400,Are these loose on your head?,N,No. The headset fits snugly on the head. They're not too tight though.
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,18-Aug-14,1408345200,"Is the box in German? Because I'm ordering this from the US, but the image has the box in German. It shouldn't be too much of a problem, just curious.",Y,"I don't have the packaging anymore but from looking at the images, it's showing English at very top of each feature and then showing other languages in smaller type underneath. So I think it should be alright. Although to add to this, my microphone part was no longer recognized by Windows even though the headphones still work great."
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,24-Mar-15,1427180400,is this a good headset if i need to hear people calling my name?,?,"With the open foam ear cups, you have very good ambient awareness. Sound quality is very good, although sensitivity is a little low if you try to use these for mobile device."
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,5 days ago,,Does it have a mute button for the mic?,N,No.
open-ended,B0087ZMATE,20-Dec-14,1419062400,"Will these work on the ps4? If not, do I need an adapter?",,"The Sennheiser PC 310 Gaming Headset has a 3.5mm stereo (a.k.a. 1/8"" or ""mini"") plug and a same size microphone jack/plug...so if that is what size your ps4 requires then this will work. These size plugs are very commom form factor used in many electronics, smartphones, mp3 players, tablet/laptops, clock radios etc"
open-ended,B0087ZMATE,10-Dec-14,1418198400,What is the warranty time?,,"The box says 2 years, but I don't know exactly what sort of problems this warranty covers."
open-ended,B0087ZMATE,4-Oct-14,1412406000,"I am wondering if the mic volume is very good or not. I have a cheaper headset and the mic is almost inaudible, even when boosted from the PC",,Mic works really well.
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,15-Sep-14,1410764400,"Is the sound surround, stereo or mono?",?,Stereo
yes/no,B0087ZMATE,24-Oct-14,1414134000,Does it work n skype,?,"This works very well, in Skype. The mic is good, and the noise-cancelling doesn't seem to cause any discernible lag, according to those I've asked, since I got this. I don't seem to hear any of those pregnant pauses that seem to plague my cell phone."
open-ended,B0087ZMATE,6-Sep-14,1409986800,Are the ear cups over-the-ear (like ear muffs) or do they sit on top of the ear like earpads?,,"They are on ear, not bad for sound isolation though."
open-ended,B0087ZMAUS,15-Apr-14,1397545200,"Is this a USB headset, or does it have 2 x 3.5mm TRS connectors (Audio and Microphone)?",,It is a USB headset with 3.5mm connectors for audio and mic.
open-ended,B0087ZMAUS,24-Oct-13,1382598000,How good is the mic quality compared to the PC 360's?,,"I own both headsets and they both use the same technology for the Microphone. I use it to record audio and if I had to choose between the two I would pick the 360 by very close margin. hope this helps. But honestly, you cant go wrong with either headset."
open-ended,B0087ZMAUS,17-Feb-14,1392624000,Are these open eared? Will i be able to hear whats going on around me and myself talk? Thanks.,,They are considered open ear headphones -- cloth ear cuffs.
open-ended,B0087ZMAUS,10-Oct-14,1412924400,"Sorry not to ask again, but, I want to get a good idea before making a purchase. Do these feel sturdy or more flimsy?",,"Sturdy and comfortable, you can wear them for hours and they never get uncomfortable. But certainly sturdy and durable."
open-ended,B0087ZMAUS,9-Oct-14,1412838000,Do they feel cheap with them being like all plastic and can people around you hear what you are listening to?,,"I think they feel like you would expect them to. it's not hollow plastic, so it feels denser, but it is very plasticky. People around you cannot hear what you are listening to. They are ""open"" in the sense that they aren't noise cancelling as much as one with leather or faux leather are, but they don't allow the speakers to be heard much even if the headset is around your neck."
yes/no,B0087ZMAUS,27-Aug-14,1409122800,"The 350 SE seem to be relatively Quiet, do these also require an Amp?",N,"They do not require an amplifier. And they also include a USB sound device which powers them such that you will actually need to turn down the analog volume control on the headset to listen at a comfortable level. When the integrated volume control is at full, you should probably set your regular sound card to 20% or so. Or set your sound device to full and turn down the headset."
open-ended,B00886XQO0,6-Aug-14,1407308400,This or turtle beach xp510 ? Is there differences between these two headsets?,,Hardware wise they are the same. Looks and Audio presets are slightly different.

open-ended,B008GEH9HO,20 days ago,,"For anyone that just bought this recently, what's the original firmware version that it came in?",,Hello there. The one we have for sale originally came with 4.5 however we may own different releases. Check this site to match your serial number and you may be able to find out which yours came with. http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/3DS_hacking_faq#Can_you_check_the_System_version_before_buying_a_new_3DS.3F

yes/no,B008GEH8LQ,1-May-14,1398927600,can it play japanese inported games,Y,"Hi there Torey W! Unfortuneately, the 3DS series is completely regionlocked (3DS/i/XL/[2DS]). There are, I believe, three regions - Europe-Australia / Canada-America / Asia. If you buy a 3DS in America, it can only play games from America. If you are interested in buying a Japanese version of the 3DSXL, you'll need to look into buying a 3DSLL, which is the name of the system in Japan. It'll be expensive, but there are so, SO many more colors and combinations that you can buy. That said, it is still possible to interact with people who have different region-locks. Even though my 3DS is American, I can still interact with Japanese and European 3DS' in all ways. I hope this helps!!"

yes/no,B008GEH8LQ,31-Dec-14,1420012800,Is this like a store bought 3DS XL?,Y,"Yes. It is the exact same product from Nintendo as the ones seen in store. Just be sure you are getting the color you want, which will be labeled in the description. The color scheme (ex. red/black) means the lid or top of the DS is red and the bottom portion is black. The lower portion on all 3DS XL's are black unless it is a special edition which it would specify. Hope this answer helps. I love my 3DS XL. Worth the purchase."

Unless you can tell me which gaming chair it is, I would get a headset like the PX22, Shadow, or Z60 that has a detachable inline amp. These would work as a passive headset using a 3.5mm jack or an amplified headset with USB -- you would have options. Another option that does not use an inline amp at all is the X12 -- 3.5mm plug for game audio and a 3.5mm plug for chat audio. If you have a link to the actual chair I can investigate it for you."
yes/no,B008M4BNQ6,14-Dec-14,1418544000,Is this compatible with the Xbox One?,?,"Only if you purchase a headset audio adapter and route the game audio through your TV.

open-ended,B008M4BNQ6,9-Feb-15,1423468800,"if my tv doesn't have output jacks, will these work or...",,Probably not. These get audio from the RCA audio jacks and game audio from the 1/8 inch jack that connect to the xbox controller. If your using a tv with just a cable connection you could hook up a VCR and utilize that component to view channels and get the audio out. Or possibly connect directly to the output from the cable box as most of them have multiple outputs on them. Hope this helps.
open-ended,B008M4BNQ6,9-Dec-14,1418112000,Can you also use this for Bluetooth or iPhone?,,"Amanda this is strictly a wired headset, and while you can use it with a PC, it won't work with a mobile device. Let me know if you are looking for a wired or wireless device. And let me know if you want it to work with both an Xbox 360 AND a mobile device, or just a mobile device.

open-ended,B008M4BNQ6,3-Dec-14,1417593600,Can these be plugged into the actual controller or do they HAVE to be connected via the console?,,"On a 360 you plug them into the controller for chat, and the console for game audio and power."
yes/no,B008M4BNQ6,19-Dec-14,1418976000,can these be used on my pc to watch videos,?,Yes you may need an adapter to convert your your headphone/line out jack to the RCA connections for the headphones.

open-ended,B008M4BNQ6,10-Dec-14,1418198400,does anyone know if these can be plugged into a gaming chair and used thru the chairs plugs?,,"Vikki, I am not sure how many gaming chairs will have a USB port to support amplified headsets. Unless you can tell me which gaming chair it is, I would get a headset like the PX22, Shadow, or Z60 that has a detachable inline amp. These would work as a passive headset using a 3.5mm jack or an amplified headset with USB -- you would have options. Another option that does not use an inline amp at all is the X12 -- 3.5mm plug for game audio and a 3.5mm plug for chat audio. If you have a link to the actual chair I can investigate it for you."
yes/no,B008M4BNQ6,14-Dec-14,1418544000,Is this compatible with the Xbox One?,?,"Only if you purchase a headset audio adapter and route the game audio through your TV.

open-ended,B008M4BNQ6,9-Feb-15,1423468800,"if my tv doesn't have output jacks, will these work or...",,Probably not. These get audio from the RCA audio jacks and game audio from the 1/8 inch jack that connect to the xbox controller. If your using a tv with just a cable connection you could hook up a VCR and utilize that component to view channels and get the audio out. Or possibly connect directly to the output from the cable box as most of them have multiple outputs on them. Hope this helps.

I bought my game in October, but when I looked at more recent reviews, people still seem to have problems with launch. I would like to have this slot game too...if it would work! I would not recommend buying this game. It's not that it wasn't like the ones in the casino, or worked too slowly or didn't pay off too much or too little, it didn't work at all! Buyer beware! Look at the number of reviews that have the exact same complaints about the game and then decide it you think you might get one that actually works. I do have a laptop and some people have said that is why it didn't install, but I have 3 WMS and Reel Deal slots that work perfectly fine on my laptop. Good luck!"

Windows 7: Not so obvious: Goto system tray: Right click ""Sound"" (Speaker Icon) Click 'Sounds' in the context menu that pops up. In the Sound Dialog Box, look for 'Recording'. Speak into your microphone, and observe whether or not green bars are displayed to the right of the active/default device (notated by a green check mark).

The Special Edition has its volume control built-in on the right ear cup, which in my opinion, is much better. Also, the PC 350 SE comes with a carrying case, while if I'm not mistaken, the old 350 does not. Overall, the PC 350 SE is a totally improved PC 350, so the obvious choice would be to buy the SE, rather than buying the older model."

I actually prefer to hear things in the room and the pc360's are nice for that, plus I think I prefer their sound slightly better but I had to sell one so I sold the PC360's. I use the ""Listen to this device"" soundblaster option so I can at least hear myself talk through the microphone on the pc350se's"

The PC360 is OPEN back meaning they leak sound but have a MUCH better soundstage (the perception you gain of where the sound is coming from) than a closed back headset. I have both (PC 350 and PC 360) and the PC 360 wins, hands down. I cannot describe to you the difference between open back and closed back. You just have to experience it for yourself. At first, I thought I wanted a closed back headset (PC 350). Now, having experienced the soundstage presented by an open back headset (PC 360), I am convinced that an open back design is the best."

yes/no,B008QLUTHO,30-Jul-14,1406703600,Can you change de language settings to dutch?,?,"I looked online for an answer to this question and it seems you can change the language to Dutch if you are willing to edit your system registry files. There is a You Tube video showing how to do this (http://youtu.be/4BxpBYoA7Sk) and webpage with the same information (http://sims3.crinrict.com/en/2013/04/change-the-language.html). Please be advised that changing registry information can make Windows, your game, and/or your computer to stop working properly; You must feel comfortable and knowledgeable before taking this action of editing. If the links I have included are not posted by Amazon just Google/search ""how to change language on sims 3"" or "" sims 3 in other languages"" Please note that the region of the disc will limit the installation choices for language from the game start up screen. Region 1 appears to only offer the game in English, Spanish, and French. Region 2 appears to have a few more options for languages. Because of these region limitations, registry editing is the only way to change the language if it is not offered on the start up screen. Also know that if you edit your registry for the game to Dutch (nl-NL) you will need to do the same for all expansion pack registries. Finally, remember the Sims speak their own language so if you are attempting to make the Sims characters speak Dutch it is impossible. The Sims characters all speak Simlish - Sims language that cannot be changed. Good luck to you with this and be very careful if changing your registry. Note: I have never personally changed my game's language. This information is based on what I found by research online (I was curious myself if it could be done successfully.)"

yes/no,B008RA5AWS,6-Mar-13,1362556800,Is QB Pro 2013 with enhanced payroll offered for multi user license for 2 users,?,"It is my understanding that they offer only a single or three-user license. They are very helpful, go on-line and get their contact telephone number for sales they can give you the details"
yes/no,B008RA5AWS,9-Sep-13,1378710000,"Once i purchase the Quickbooks Pro 2013 with Enhanced Payroll, will i still need to purchase a year subscription ??",?,Only if you want to upgrade to unlimited employees. The Enhanced will only allow you to pay up to three employees. If you process more than three you will be charged by Quickbooks per employee.
open-ended,B008RA5AWS,2-Jan-13,1357113600,Can I install it on my business computer and my home computer so that I can work at home if necessary?,,"Yes. Here is the official Intuit position on this: ""With a single-user license, you can install QuickBooks on 1 computer and on 1 additional portable computer (e.g., a laptop that you own and use in your business) as long as both devices are used by the same person. ONLY that specified person can access and use QuickBooks on both computers."" My note: the second computer does NOT need to be a laptop or portable, but the rest of the conditions apply. Let me know if you need more info."
open-ended,B008RA5AWS,23-Jan-13,1358928000,What is the annual fee for the payroll for three or more?,,"Extra $100 for 4+ employees. I just called. It's a bit of a hassle if you already have a payroll subscription, like I do. First you have to cxl your current subscription, then install the payroll disc and then call and they charge you the full whack ($429) for enhanced payroll, then credit back the value they assign to the enhanced payroll of 3 or fewer employees ($329). SO, if you get the enhanced payroll for less than $329 off the shelf (i.e. Costco or Amazon), then you decide if it's worth the hassle. From everything I've read, the 2013 QB Pro is not something to be super excited about, and may even boggle your brain due to poorer visual interface, new report menu format, etc. I'm thinking about getting the Value pack and if I can do the payroll only, and without simultaneously upgrading the QB Pro, then that's what I'll do for now."

open-ended,B008RA5AWS,9-Sep-13,1378710000,"When purchasing the Enhanced Payroll (1 employee)does it give me the 1st yr subscription with it, or is it additional $ for subscribing?",,Yes it includes a 1 yr subscription. I find this amazing because Quckbooks was going to charge me in Oct. $349.00 for my one year but I saved that by buying the QB's Pro 2013 upgrade and the one year P/R. I guss I will buy a payroll package from Amazon each year now.

open-ended,B008RA5AWS,15-Aug-13,1376550000,how do you know if software processes 0-3 employees versus unlimited ?,,The answer is on your payroll key. It says unlimited or 0-3 employees

Is this true?",,"Yes, Intuit will still provide support even though you don't purchase the product directly from them. We have had no problem with calling them up and asking for assistance. You get the actual QuickBooks Pro 2013 - 3 User product."
yes/no,B008RA5DIY,17-Mar-13,1363503600,can I get on from a remote location as long as only 2 others are on?,?,The short answer is yes you can. You have to have a server set up (which you must have done) and be able to get through your firewall. Perhaps you have security set up already and will need to use tunneling software from a remote location.
open-ended,B008RA5DIY,30-Jan-13,1359532800,Is this an actual disc or download only? I really want/need the disc,,This is a disc.

It has the capability of converting the data back and forth between the Mac and PC versions if required. There are also a few functionality and feature differences between the Mac and PC versions, but they are pretty close."
yes/no,B008RA5DIY,29-May-13,1369810800,"If we purchase the actual disc, are we able to download also?",?,"I think that is one for Quicken staff. I would think it is one or the other. Disk or download. Not sure, but disk is sometimes a little higher price than download. I choose disk because I move around to different machines and I think it would be less hassle than placing or removing the licenses on those machines."

Make sure you know if Skylanders Giants or Trapteam or Swap Force is actual game he has, as figures only work on certain games. Hope this helps."

You might Google the question to see if it will work. Thanks.
yes/no,B0098EVZZ8,13-Dec-13,1386921600,Do these work with the skylander giants battle arena?,Y,Yes they do! As they come out with new game the old skylanders still work even with the new game. The new one just don't work with the old games. Example you can't use a swapforce with the giants game but you can use and skylander on the swapforce game. Hope that helps.

TIA",,"The Wii U Pro controller is only designed for Wii U games. Wii games on Wii U can only be played with controllers that were supported by the regular Wii, such as the regular Wiimote, wiimote+nunchuck, or the Classic Controller Pro. The Wii U also does not have slots for a gamecube controller so those can't be used as well. You'll need a wiimote, the good news is that a lot of Wii U games actually support this older controller and it can be used to navigate Wii U menus so it wouldn't be a bad purchase http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Wii-Remote-Plus-Black/dp/B0094X28J0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412875287&sr=8-1&keywords=wiimote"

Although, over the ages and various controllers it differs from numbing like a pager to hard hitting. This is a middle ground. Gyro sensor is not in the controller - it's not like a wii mote, or six axis knockoff. It's a pure controller with analogs, digitals, and rumble. 80 hours of battery life too!"

The pro controller uses a mini USB cable. You can't interchange the two. The pro controller connects wirelessly to the console, but uses the cable for charging; same as the game pad. The game pad and pro controller do not connect to each other."

Spiderman cube,,"Hi M.J., I'm not entirely sure why it says 'almost' all Wii games. The Wii U actually has a Wii menu. When you select this Wii menu from the Wii U home screen, it looks exactly as the original Wii's home menu does. From here, you are able to play any Wii games you have, so long as you have the Wii remote and/or nunchuk that are required for the specific game because the Wii U gamepad cannot be used as a controller for original Wii games. Also, according to Nintendo's website, Wii games will not display in HD on the Wii U console, just as they wouldn't on the original Wii. So overall you should not have a problem playing any of your Wii games on the Wii U as long as they are not scratched or damaged too badly. Hope this helps."
open-ended,B009AGXH64,27-May-14,1401174000,Why is this one $10 more than the one that comes with mario and luigi U?,,"It depends on where you buy from, a lot of different online stores in amazon charge different prices. If you are comparing 2 prices from amazon, one console might be on sale."

While Wii games will play in a Wii U, Wii U games will NOT play in a Wii. Sorry if that seems obvious, I've had a lot of confused friends who thought the Wii U was just some kind of add on and not a new system. The Wii U is in true HD, with HDMI out. It's also not dependent on the motion controls any more, so a lot more games make use of the pro controller, a lot like the older pro controller for the Wii minus the need to plug it into the remote. That being said most games allow you to pick your control type, so if you loved tilt controls in Mario Kart Wii you can still use them, like the pro controller you can use that too. I owned a Wii and I've had a Wii U for a little while now and I would say the quality of the games for the Wii U is much much higher. Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3 and Super Smash Bros Wii U are, for my money, the best yet in their respective lines. Also the new games are outstanding, such as Hyrule Warriors and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. The Wii U also introduces the ability to buy any game as a digital download, same day as the stores. Most big releases even get a midnight digital release! The Wii U interacts with the amiibos, that besides being awesome figures unlocks content in Nintendo games! The Wii U takes everything good about the Wii and makes it amazing!"

It does not natively support GameCube controllers but with the new adapter (shown in E3 2014) it will support both wired and wireless GameCube controllers."

However, please be aware that (as indicated by the picture) this is the Japanese model. As such, you'll notice the text on the box is in Japanese. I have not noticed any compatibility issues whatsoever. For that matter, the controller feels and responds exactly like my US version Pro controller.

The Circle Pad Pro means you don't have to use the touch pad to work the camera controls, so it makes the game 100 times easier to play. Just make sure that you have a 3DS that the Circle Pad Pro will fit because it will not fit a 3DS XL. (They made a Circle Pad Pro later on that would fit the XL, but I don't know if they still make it.)"
yes/no,B009B1D7JK,22-May-14,1400742000,Is monster hunter 3 Ultimate for 3ds easy to play?,?,"To be honest, no. It's difficult, but difficult in a way that's often very rewarding for a player when the time and effort is put in to learn monster attack patterns and optimal attack strategies per weapon. There are guides all over the internet and on YouTube to help a new player out with these things; I recommend ProJared's Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate videos for help starting out, and then a good search of whatever weapons a new player wants to pick up to see them in action. My first night playing I knew nothing and it took several hours for my group to down our first big monster, but then I watched, listened and practiced and the next night we played I was fantastic, knew where to go, how to hit and was prepared for everything that could be thrown at us. It's not easy to play, but it feels really, really good when you start to master it."

yes/no,B009D3HSTG,7-Dec-14,1417939200,Does it work on Windows 8.1 and does it come with a CD?,Y,"Yes it does work on Windows 8.1. It does not come with a CD. You have to download an N64 emulator of your choice and then plug in your controller. Once the controller is plugged in and windows recognizes the controller, you can go into your key configurations under the settings in the emulator and edit the keys yourself. Some emulators do require you to manually enter each key one at a time. The product works amazingly. Bought 4 myself and have it all running on my PC."
yes/no,B009D3HSTG,10-May-14,1399705200,"Does this have a ""rumble pak"" built into it?",?,No it does not. It feels lighter than the Nintendo 64 controller as well.

yes/no,B009D3HSTG,28-Jun-14,1403938800,Is it possible to use two of these at a time and play multiplayer games?,Y,"Yes, though it really depends on what emulator you use. I use project 64 and it goes up to four. What emulator do you use?"

Try either using a dab of superglue on the metal part where the joystick slides on, or for a less intrusive method, use a small piece of paper towel between the metal part and the joystick. Hopefully, part of the paper towel will get wedged between the metal stick and the inside of the joystick, strengthening the bond. Hope this helps."

open-ended,B009D3HSTG,30-Dec-14,1419926400,i pluged it into the computer it says the usb device is not recognized ive put in the cd and installed the hardware it still doesnt work why?,,Because you have to go into your emulator settings and manually set the keys to the emulator. You can't expect your computer and a CD to do all of your work for you considering you are most likely trying to play games that are illegally obtained. Open your emulator and go to your controller settings and manually enter each key in. When you go to the settings it will display all the controls and what they are set to on your keyboard as this is a default universal controller to all computers.
yes/no,B009DL2TBA,14-Mar-15,1426316400,does it play Japanese games,Y,"Yes. The PS3 is ""region free"", however if you plan on buying any downloads for those games, you would have to buy them from the Japanese Playstation Store."

There are 4 or so buttons that you use your thumb to click, though I suppose you could use your pinky to use them. But that's only if you plan on using it to game fully- I use mine as a regular mouse without using many of the extra buttons ;) So it depends on your intended use."
open-ended,B009F7G0AI,4-Mar-14,1393920000,Do you know if you can use this mouse with Windows 8?,,"It will work with any computer with a usb port. That has windows xp or later.

open-ended,B009LWQ0H0,24-Jun-13,1372057200,Mouse driven or WASD?,,"Hey, I am not entirely sure what part of the game you are specifying so I will just try to answer it with the following information: There are 3 different camera angles in this game: there is an over the shoulder third person view; an isometric perspective/ dungeon crawler angle (games like Diablo 3); and then one thats just more of zoomed out 3rd person perspective. If you play with the over the shoulder third person view then you will be moving/strafing your character with WASD and your combat will be based on a combo of the keyboard (inventory/weapon/style selection) and mouse (mouse is used for aiming, and sword fighting because the game uses a mechanic where you click the mouse at specific times for the ideal swing). If you play with the isometric view then you can just use the mouse for movement and combat, with the keyboard being used for inventory, weapon, sword style selection. Hope that helps!"

Two use the mouse , one uses WSAD and the mouse to look around. Each is basically how you see things(Its all a third person view). You use the keyboard for quick actions or you can click through the HUD. Its a fun game. The Enhanced Edition comes with a lot of extras contained in its files."

Sometimes children don't want to take the time to read the instructions, but they have an amazing way of figuring it out on the fly. That said, there are instructions if a child should get stuck, so don't let them give up too easily. If your child loves trains, has an imagination, and any sort of engineering or problem-solving skills, this is a good learning and fun game/software to buy for them."

Another thing. It would be great if they produced a manual to show and explain a lot of the operation. For a beginner like myself. Half the time I am lost and have no ideal of what to do next.

Unless you get some heavy duty headphones, most will break if not taken care of properly. I hang mine on a hook when I'm not using mine. Or, it could be a wiring issue when the headphones themselves aren't messed up, but maybe the wires did get messed up. To prevent this issue, I keep my wires twisty-tied together so they don't touch the floor. I've gone through extensive research on how to protect headphones because I've had a few that I've gone through and finally found that if you take good care in protecting them & making sure they're taken care of, you can prevent these damaging issues.

open-ended,B00A2WP4UC,4-Jul-14,1404457200,can you use this system to watch netflix and/or amazon instant videos?...Is there internet accessibility with this particular system?,,"Yes you can watch netflix and amazon instant video through your wifi internet. There are some other apps such as weather channel and nintendo shop as well. If you are getting this for that it is great but they are discontinuing making regular wii games now which means you will only be able to buy used games or what wii games they have left in store, no up to date games. The Wii U is the new system that also plays wii games and wii u games. The wii U is also expensive. I bought the wii skylanders giant pack for my 5 year old and he loves it, we find regular wii games at yard sales all the time cheap or at gamestop. Maybe when he is older I will buy him a more expensive game system but not while he is so young."

open-ended,B00A378L4C,30-Jul-14,1406703600,CM Storm QuickFire TK or Corsair Vengeance K70,,"The k70 is a great buy for most all. The build quality of both the TK and the K70 are pretty close but K70 takes the pot. Your options on the k70 are huge brown, blue, and red switches coming in with either black aluminum or silver; n-key roll over easy-Access Dedicated Multimedia Controls etc. The K70 is sleek and professional looking to the point you can take it to work and use it there. Now, the CM Storm QuickFire TK is minimalistic you get what you get and thats it. Not talking down on the product, the product is great. When put side by side with the K70 though, the K70 is the clear choice. For all the options and great features its hard to go wrong with K70. Plus,(depending on what key switch you're getting) you're not spending that much more, but in the end you know where that little extra is going. To answer your Question: K70 is your choice."

Also, I see tat the default function of the ""2"" is up arrow",?,The number pad and arrow/home keys are integrated together. You switch between the number keys and arrow keys with the number lock key. So if you want to use the number pad you hit the number lock key which turns off the arrow/home keys and vise-versa. Makes a full size keyboard more of a ten keyless size which I like.

This site here: http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/ offers a pretty decent guide to what different types of mechanical switches are and do.

yes/no,B00A378L10,26-Dec-14,1419580800,Can the keycaps on this keyboard be replaced with other keycaps?,Y,"Yes, the keycaps can be easily swapped out with the included keycap removal tool--but it's worth noting that you will have a hard time customizing the bottom row. While most mechanical keyboards have R1 modifier keys (bottom row keys CTRL, SUPER, META, and ALT) that are all 1.25 size-or 1.25 times the width of a standard letter key-and a 6.25 spacebar, the CM Storm QuickFire TK has unconventional sizes for most of them: From left to right, the bottom row sizes on the TK are 1.5 / 1 / 1.25 / 6.5 / 1.25 / 1 / 1 / 1.5. The 1.25's can be easily swapped as they're the standard size, and the 1's can be replaced with any custom printed ""ZXCV"" key. The 1.5's are trickier: A reprinted Tab key would be the correct width, but as it's much higher up on the keyboard (R3) it won't have the same profile as the other (R1) keys to which it's adjacent. The real problem is the 6.5 spacebar, which is practically unheard of. Only one other keyboard has done it (the Corsair K70), so swapping in a custom version may ultimately prove impossible. Of course, this is all only relevant if you plan on customizing the bottom row--there's nothing inherently wrong with the layout, it simply has non-standard keycap sizes."
yes/no,B00A378L10,27-Jan-14,1390809600,"Hey guys, I have a laptop, does this just plug right in through usb port?",Y,"Yes it does, it is a great buy. Hope this helps"

The heat from a persons hand tends to make it feel sticky over time and I'm constantly readjusting so there's a bit more glide between mouse movements. The material on top of the mouse would be a better replacement to the plastic right palm side. The mouse wheel feels a bit odd and stiff to scroll, but i believe it'll go away once it's more broken in. The mouse is pretty nice and is wide enough that my hand can comfortably hold it. I still need some further time with it though to see how it is in the long run of gaming. Still it is a pretty nice mouse though for the price."

yes/no,B00AAQRNQ8,15-Jul-13,1373871600,Can you program one of the buttons (side button preferably) to drop the DPI to a specified level only while being held then back to normal on release?,?,"For some reason I got an email of this question, I bought the 4000 dpi version and you can't set it like you asked. I did read the 4000 has less options in the software that comes with it compared to the more expensive higher dpi versions. Probably doesn't help but the best I can do."

Ex: Oblivion, Skyrim",,There is a main hub that people you meet along your journey will also travel to and you can fast travel there from any bonfire you have lit to trade or level up.
yes/no,B00AK4QB22,12-Dec-14,1418371200,Do I have to have X Box live for this game?,N,No
open-ended,B00AK4QB22,14-Mar-15,1426316400,is it region free or locked on NTSC?,,You can decide to have it region lock or worldwide in the in-game settings.
yes/no,B00AK4QB22,23-Dec-14,1419321600,Will this play on the Xbox One?,N,I would say no because the Xbox One is not backwards compatible.
yes/no,B00AK4QB22,19-Jul-14,1405753200,Can you play as a female character?,Y,"Yes. You pick gender, hair, features and build."
open-ended,B00AK4QB22,23-Jul-14,1406098800,The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?,,Yes.It does.
yes/no,B00AK4QB22,26-Feb-15,1424937600,do you have to be on xbox live in order to play these dark souls games online?,Y,Yes. It will require an Xbox live gold subscription.
open-ended,B00AK4QB22,2-Aug-14,1406962800,Why does it have a Teen rating vs. Mature?,,"Well, there really isn't much mature content in the game at all. Very minor coarse language, no smoking/drinking, no sexual themes. There's violence, sure, but no excessive gore or blood."
yes/no,B00AKIPBNS,12-Apr-14,1397286000,"If I've never played a Fire Emblem game, will I still understand/enjoy this game?",Y,"Yes, absolutely. Play it on the easiest difficulty your first time through as you learn the mechanics (normal, classic) and dont be afraid to look up any questions online. I had never played an FE game before and I loved it."
open-ended,B00AKIPBNS,16-May-14,1400223600,"I've heard that in the Fire Emblem series, there is something called PermaDeath. Is that Permanent Death? If it is, can it be turned off?",,"Yes, it's called Casual Mode, and you can choose whether to play through the game with it or not."
open-ended,B00AKIPBNS,12-May-14,1399878000,What's so special about Fire Emblem Awakening compared to it's predecessors?,,"There's a couple things that I feel really help it stand out. For starters there's the relationship system that's in place - which not only gives better bonuses when people with higher relationships are next to one another, but it also unlocks conversations between party members that can be insightful, and entertaining. (I love character development, personally). Relationships that reach an S status can also result in 2nd and 3rd generations entering into the game. Don't fret! this is handled well, and plays in line with some of the other options of the game. It's not as forced as it may sound on the surface. Secondly are the reeking boxes and maps you can download. The boxes are ingame items purchased with ingame currency and let you create random battles to help level up your army and build relationships. These things are invaluable. The maps you can purchase are a lot of fun, and often give you boosts in income or experience, but they don't impact the game itself - you're not missing out on important game stuff if you skip buying these. Lastly, the option of playing casual or old school is nice. Casual removes the finality of death, and it's a great option when you just feel like relaxing and enjoying the story. Old School is great because it's nice to be able to play the game as intended. You can play either of these options on easy or hard settings on top of it all. There's a little more to it than that, but those are the things that I feel stand apart from previous versions. I've gotten pretty deep into the game, and I really can't find anything to complain about so far. I'm enjoying building relationships, and the story is interesting, and the game play smooth. If you've enjoyed past Fire Emblems, chances are high you'll enjoy this one."
open-ended,B00AKIPBNS,23-Apr-14,1398236400,Which 3DS region lock does this game have? Does it depend on where it's ordered from?,,I would say it's US locked. I live in the US and it works fine on my system.
yes/no,B00AKIPBNS,29-Oct-14,1414566000,"I understand the 3ds is region locked, does that mean only US-bought 3ds will be able to play this even if you have the physical copy?",?,Correct U.S game requires a U.S game boy
yes/no,B00AKIPBNS,21-Jan-15,1421827200,"Once you beat the game/story, can you replay the game at a higher difficulty with your progressed and high level characters?",?,"you can only transfer your ""avatar"" character to use on other files, but you need to ""recruit"" him by paying a considerable ammount of gold. Besides that, no, you need to start every difficulty from scratch. thats part of the experience though if you ask me."
yes/no,B00AKIPBNS,26-Mar-15,1427353200,IS this appropriate for a 8-9 year old?,?,I would not recommend it. It is quite violent and can be sexually suggestive at times. You could look into another series i play which is Rune Factory.
yes/no,B00AKIPBNS,24-Jul-14,1406185200,does a poster come with the game i see it in the images lol,?,"When I got it, there was no poster. There was only the game box with instructions and the game itself."

yes/no,B00ANHBJBY,4-May-14,1399186800,Hey guys I'm having trouble with this controller in Wii Mode. Able to sync but the battery is always 0% in Wii Mode after charging. Can anyone help?,?,Kristin nailed it. Its for the Wii U only. It won't act like a classic controller
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,1-Aug-14,1406876400,How does this compare to the nintendo one?,,"The right thumbstick is offset like the Xbox Controller, which makes it a more comfortable controller IMO. It's also cheaper. However, I've had 3 of these and the left thumbstick lost tension on all of them after 3 months of moderate use. You can find the Japanese import of the official Wii U controller for $39 on here. I would suggest buying the more reliable controller."
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,9-Jun-14,1402297200,How is the analog stick sensitivity on this? Does it have any dead zones? Do the buttons feel soft or clicky?,,The buttons are pretty clicky but the analog sticks do have some dead zone. It's not so much that it gets really annoying but just enough to notice.
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,5-Aug-14,1407222000,About how long is the battery life (those of you who got actually functioning units)? Does it compare to the WiiU Pro's 50+ hours?,,For me is very long lasting work more time versus wii u remote
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,22-Sep-14,1411369200,Does this controller work on all Wii U &amp; Wii games? Does it do the job for Mario Kart? Mario Bros.? or Donkey kong? etc.,,"It does not. Any game that requires the use of the gamepad will not work with the Pro Commander alone. But that often means you have to just use the Wii U Gamepad to power a game on, and then you can use the Pro Commander. Speaking from personal experience, Mario Kart works great with just the PC, but New Super Mario Bros needs a Gamepad to boot."
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,16-Jan-15,1421395200,How would this work for Smash?,,It's supposed to be awesome for Smash. That is the reason my son asked for this controller. 1st Item I purchase did not keep a charge. So I had to send it back. I reordered a new one.
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,14-Dec-14,1418544000,Will this controller work with the new Super Smash Bros. Wii U game? Does it register as a pro controller?,,"Yes, it is actually really good for super smash."
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,14-Dec-14,1418544000,Controller only works when plugged in. Is there a color that indicates when the thing is fully charged? Or did I just receive a bad unit?,,A red light appears when it's charging.when it's done it goes away.Your controller should be able to work wireless if it doesn't then it's defective.
open-ended,B00ANHBJBY,29-Nov-14,1417248000,Does anyone know how well this holds up in games like Super Smash bros? The responsiveness and durability for example.,,I doubt it the buttons on it are pretty crappy. You have to push them very hard to get them to register. Didn't play smash with it but it was pretty bad for mario kart.
yes/no,B00AQ2BLI2,2-Jul-14,1404284400,Does the disc version still require steam to play?,Y,"Yes, you'll have to create an account, or use a previous one. If you dint have stream downloaded, during installation of shogun 2 out will ask you to download it for you. Hope this helps."
open-ended,B00AQ2BLI2,13-Jul-14,1405234800,when recruiting units is it like Rome 1 that is 1 unit per turn or can it be multiple?,,"It can be 1 per turn depending on how upgraded the castle and province is. Generally ashigaru (commoners with weapons) units are recruited quickly. (1 turn = 1 season) More skilled units (Samurai, Kisho Ninja, Warrior Monks) will take longer 2-4 turns."

yes/no,B00AQ2BLI2,22-Sep-14,1411369200,is it have chinese language?,?,"I look into the resources of the disc and just bring manuals in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian. Sorry but I dont see any chinesse, but you know what maybe when you installed trough steam they give you another lenguage option because that game is WOW"
yes/no,B00AQ2BLI2,5-Sep-14,1409900400,Does it contain the original game? I accidentally buy the part 2 but it does not contain the original game. I can't play it now.,?,Yeah the one I got came with original case and game with everything in it like instructions and the product key.

I heard some complaints about M65 acceleration,iso I want to know which one you recommend, especially for gaming?",,"First off, the two mice are physically similar; except for maybe less than an ounce of weight difference. The button placement is identical, as well as the ergonomics. Aside from the M65's better DPI, I don't see any differences in specs (at least on paper). I haven't felt any acceleration or ""floaty"" quality with this mouse, though I don't play roles that require absolute pixel-accuracy. This mouse has been great for my lazy grip, which is a half way point between palming and griping the mouse. While it may sound odd, I have another mouse plugged -- a Logitech G502. That is perfect for a claw grip and works best for me when I want to change up how I play. --- ADDITION --- After doing a bit of reading, I found out both the m60 and m65 have 3-5% positive acceleration (and can't be turned off). I suppose I've adapted to it though since it's a common thing in most mice I own, apparently."

This is the non-stealth version with features Cherry MX Blue switches, which are tactile, mechanical switches with a defined break point and ""clicky"" feedback. The stealth version uses Cherry MX Brown switches, which are also tactile, mechanical switches, but do not have ""clicky"" feed back and have an actuation force about 10g less than the Cherry MX Blues. I'm not sure why Razer doesn't make one available using MX Blacks, since they are better for gaming then either the MX Blues or Browns. Anyway, Ben is wrong because the Nostromo/Tartarus uses RUBBER DOME MEMBRANE switches, NOT mechanical ones like the Stealth does. Jarlax is wrong because the switches are quite different, the clicky feedback with the Blues is MUCH more pronounced than the Browns.

It has a good solid click to it, and each of the 8 positions can be mapped to whichever keys you like. The only problem I've had is that the 4 diagonal positions are very hard to achieve without first actuating one of the ""polar"" positions. In other words, say you wanted position 2 which would be between W and D in your case. I've found it's nigh impossible to actuate position 2 without actuating either W or D first on accident.

yes/no,B00B1N07QM,26-Aug-14,1409036400,"Hello, has anyone used the Orbweaver in place of a 3D space navigator like one by 3D Conexxion? I am hoping to use one device for both purposes. ^.^",?,"I own both devices, one is not even remotely like the other. The Orbweaver is wonderful for gaming, but the 3D mouse is an incredible design that allows you to almost feel like you are handling the model you are working on. If you have never used a 3D mouse and do CAD or animation design in 3D, you need to buy the 3D mouse, it is awesome."
yes/no,B00B1N07QM,9-Oct-13,1381302000,"Does the razer software allow you to assign the buttons as ""direct input buttons (directx)"" so I can configure them using another profiling software?",?,"the software allows you to do almost any thing that you can do mechanical, if you set it up to do a function such as ctrl+alt+w and set the function up in the other program it might be possible as you can set a button to switch programs and the macro part is quite extensive if i knew more of what you wanted to do in the software i could give you a more definitive answers.however it also depends on the second set of profiling software that you use and the application e.g some app's might work better then others depending on the amount of gui based controles eg web browsers clicking on a button is not easy but you can thell it to write a sentence where you have clicked."
yes/no,B00B1N07QM,12-Mar-14,1394607600,Wife tried Nostromo and her small hand felt slightly strained to hold in the WASD position. Is this better for smaller hands?,?,This has an extra row so with smaller hands I'd imagine it would be harder to reach the extra row. It would probably be slightly better to hold in the WASD position due to the adjustable palm rest and the slider all the way closed if she doesn't care to use the extra row.
open-ended,B00B1N07QM,1-May-13,1367391600,[Solved] Does the Orbweaver store the active profile on the device like the n52te does? Does it have only the dpad for the thumb buttons?,,With the new software it looks like it saves it on your computer BUT it tries to get it from the cloud. The result is that (at least for me) it just kept forgetting which profile to use. In some cases I had to reboot to get it to select my new profile. the thumb has the dpad plus an extra button.
yes/no,B00B1N07QM,6-Nov-13,1383724800,I have small hands and I'm used to three rows of buttons (nostromo). Are 4 rows doable for most people?,?,I have somewhat smaller hands and I can barely reach the third row. So I am currently just using the bottom 2.
yes/no,B00B1N07QM,10-Dec-13,1386662400,Can you use the joystick to scroll? Ideally I would like it to be able to vertical scroll and horizontal scroll for webpages and excel.,Y,"Yes. The joystick comes pre-mapped as the arrow keys. So you could scroll like that. Or you may be able to customize it in some way. You could remap some of the joystick directions as mouse scroll wheel movement. For instance when you press the stick forward it acts as if you rolled the mouse scroll wheel forward, that should be fairly smooth for webpages. Hope this helps"

The bad news, unfortunately the arena app acts in 2 ways, first as a device driver of sorts and second as a market place to limit you to only compatable games that it deems your device powerful enough to play. Don't fret, there is 2 more bits of good news. Once the controller is paired with your device the controller is recognized as an individual device even after app is gone. And, if your device is Android 4.1 or higher it has a built-in XBox 360 controller support for a wired controller, you need a standard USB A to USB Micro adapter to make it work."

I'm not sure you need Steam if you purchase a disc, either. I did not purchase a disc. I downloaded it; so, I can only speak based on the information that I have. It will take up approx. 6Gb of hard disk space for the game without any additional DLC.

open-ended,B00BDX1M00,17-Jun-14,1402988400,What is the product warranty on recertified headsets? Are they backed by the manufacturer or by your company?,,I'm not sure but the manufacturer or company should have a warranty.
open-ended,B00BDX1M00,21-Jun-14,1403334000,What is the product warranty for the recertified headset?,,One year just like a brand new one
open-ended,B00BDX1M00,11-May-14,1399791600,what does recertified mean?,,"It means that turtle beach as a company, is certifying that this product is up to their standards for resale."

open-ended,B00BFOEY4I,2-Jul-14,1404284400,Can these be used on a cell phone or tablet with standard audio jack?,,"No, it will not work directly. You need a splitter if you want both audio and mic."
open-ended,B00BFOEY4I,28-Feb-14,1393574400,How long is the cable?,,"It comes with a very long cord, 10 feet(I measured it)...and the cable is not like the plastic ones, it is more like a nylon cord. Great quality for the price"
open-ended,B00BFOEY4I,31-Aug-14,1409468400,Good Bass Drop?,,"It's alright. Again, my review stated that you're purchasing a budget gaming headset. You aren't going to get anything stunning for your 30-40 dollar purchase, but you will certainly get more than what is necessary for gaming. You are able to hear environmentals and SFX perfectly. Bass is great for music, not so much environment. If you're looking for a musically dedicated headset, look for those without a mic. Those tend to focus more on the quality of sound and not so much the tandem."
yes/no,B00BFOEY4I,8-Jul-14,1404802800,Do they work with Macs?,?,"You will need to purchase a USB adapter. Most recent Macs have a 3.5mm line level input, but the mic will not work without an amplifier or phantom power. The G430 has the adapter included. You can purchase the G430's adapter on an auction site. It will allow you to use the G230 with a USB port."

open-ended,B00BFOEY4I,14-Jun-14,1402729200,Whats a good cheap usb sound card to use with this?,,I encourage you to ask questions on actual USB sound card products instead.
open-ended,B00BFOEY4I,11-Jun-14,1402470000,Should I pay a little extra for G430 surround sound? Is actually worth the extra few bucks in terms of the technology difference?,,"i personally think this guy's sound really good!! the ""surround sound"" on the G430 is just the external sound card, the ""adapter to convert from 3.5 to USB"" and some software tweaks so if you want a headset that can be used on PS3 buy the 430 but if is just for pc then you better buy this one."

open-ended,B00BFOEY3Y,22-Feb-14,1393056000,"Is the scroll wheel free-spinning, has click stops, or switchable (like the MX Revolution)?",,"It is switchable, similar to the MX Revolution. To switch you press the button just below the wheel instead of pressing the wheel."
open-ended,B00BFOEY3Y,17-Feb-14,1392624000,Can someone please explain dpi scaling to me? I understand that the higher dpi the easier it is to click on a pixel. Why do people want low dpi?,,In comparison a mouse set to a lower dpi will move slower on screen(exp.400dpi will move the pointer 400 pixles for every 1 inch the mouse moves where as 2000dpi can cover a whole 1080i screen with only an inch of mouse movement). Lower dpi can be usefull when an action requires more precise control and higher is great for when the pointer has to travel far and wide.
yes/no,B00BFOEY3Y,6-Sep-13,1378450800,"does the scroll wheel have a page forward, page back left and right thing?",?,"The scroll wheel does have left/right functionality.

If the price is very different I would just buy the standard edition unless you really want those two missions.
open-ended,B00BGAA0SU,28-Jul-14,1406530800,if i bought a used copy of this game would i still be able to get all the limited editions features? or is it only redeemable once?,,Only redeemable once
open-ended,B00BGAA0SU,28-Jun-14,1403938800,"Tomb raider, this or watch dogs",,"INFAMOUS SECOND SON is an exclusive title that you must have as a PS4 owner. Watchdogs is also a good open world sandbox and its also fun too. Tomb raider is more of an adventure and action game. I have all of these titles, personally I choose watchdogs because it gives more play hours and it has a lot of fun extras games that you can play online."

yes/no,B00BGA9X9W,28-Jul-14,1406530800,Does it work for pc?,Y,"Yes, but you need to find another driver to completely support this controller on PC."
open-ended,B00BGA9X9W,4-Dec-14,1417680000,Why doesn't this come with a USB cable to charge it?,,"I believe the answer to that is to save on cost, and the fact that the PS4 and almost every other device nowadays comes with a USB cord. Personally, I just use my cell phone charger if I'm not using the usb cord that came with the PS4."

The DS4 now works on the PS3 wirelessly. I can only assume that it would work for GTA5 on the PS3 as well, but MAYBE some of the special features with the PS4 version won't work--like the light in the back of the DS4 reflecting the actions of the game. I'm not sure if that would work on the PS3, might, might not, don't know."
open-ended,B00BGA9X9W,8-May-14,1399532400,Are the sticks confortable to play with? Meaning it won't slide my thumbs by mistake like with the DS3?,,"I know what you mean with the DS3, that was so annoying. On the ps4 they did a great job fixing that. I've played for hours some days and the thumb sticks stay durable and also they are a lot more comfortable than the ps3. The whole remote is a step up."
open-ended,B00BGA9X9W,25-May-14,1401001200,Can this be charged with a microUSB phone charger (wall charger) or does it have to be plugged in through a usb?,,"Wait it does? So unlike the PS3 controller (which will ONLY charge from a charging dock or the console itself or a laptop left on 24/7), when my controller's running low I can plug it into my http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-SurgePlus-3-Outlet-Charger-Protector/dp/B00ATZJ5YS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1401067989&sr=8-3&keywords=belkin+wall+charger WHILE I play with the supplied charge cable (that came with the console)? :D EDIT: June 10th 2014: Well after getting the console, I can confirm that the controller WILL charge from a wall charger, however it HAS to be a 1 amp plug. That belkin one I listed above it 2.1 amp and it will NOT work on that or the other 3 2.1 amp wall chargers I have, and it will NOT work on the like 4 .5 amp chargers I have either. It will however work on my new phone and new portable Bluetooth speaker's wall chargers, which are both 1 Amp. I guess something in the controller won't kick in to charge unless it's receiving exactly 1 Amp. Of course needing to charge one from a wall socket near you while playing becomes a moot point once you get a charging stand and a 2nd controller to swap to."
yes/no,B00BGA9X9W,19 days ago,,"If I play plugged in 24/7, will it shorten the battery life once I decided to disconnect and use the DS4 Controller wirelessly?",?,No it wont.. But if u didn't already know. The light bar uses about 80% of the power. So if it seems like ur battery is dyin faster it's because the battery is gettin old & it's time to invest in another controller. Cause the newer the controller the better the battery life... Hope this helps

open-ended,B00BI9MDSO,26-May-14,1401087600,"why do half of the people say the vita 2000 fits, and the other half say it doesn't?",,"I think it's because people have differences in opinions on the words ""fits"" and ""comfortably"". I'd also go so far as to say that these people don't take care of their systems properly. If you have to push your Vita in the case hard, and you have to use something to pry it out, that is NOT a comfortable fit. All of these people stating that the Vita 2000 model ""fits"" in this case are WRONG, and are putting their Vita in danger by putting pressure on it like that. This case is for the older model, simply put. These positive reviews from Vita Slim owners are confusing people, forcing them to buy it for themselves, only to be disappointed."

Does anyone know how to fix it?,,"I've never had that happen, but I've had some other strange problems. So far they have all been fixed by rebooting the game player. To do this, hold down the power button on the wii u control pad as if you're turning it off. However, you'll need to hold the button down long enough that the screen goes black before you let go. Wait at least two or three minutes before turning the wii u on again. As another option, you could start a second game and see if you experience the same glitch. If you still have problems, I suggest you contact the software company."
yes/no,B00BMFIXEW,30-Oct-14,1414652400,I have read that this gameon PS3 can be made to have less blood and language by using parental controls settings. Is this true also on Wii U?,?,"I have found no parental controls. In the options, under the video heading, there is a a place to turn the blood on or off. When the blood option is off, you still hear the sound of your weapon and your target still makes some disturbing gurgling noises and writhes in pain. By ""language, I assume you mean adult language. I haven't seen an option to adjust adult language. You could turn the voice volume to zero, or the language option to French or Spanish, but you would miss some necessary dialog along with a very few ""F"" bombs."

The ending kind of sneaks up on you so for that reason I don't like the story arc as much as the other games but overall it's a great game. the multiplayer hasn't changed much and as always it's worth playing.
open-ended,B00BMFIXOW,2-Jun-14,1401692400,"Could I free roam this open world map? Like for ex: Skyrim. Or is this a sand box map, ex: Dishonored? Thank you",,"Yes and no. If you ever played AC games things are blocked off until you finish missions same goes here but there's a lot of exploring to do and collectibles. The good news is after you get your ship and can customize it you can free roam about 90% of the game (hunt for buried treasure, underwater wrecks, hunt animals and get into naval battles). Its not exactly open world like Skyrim."
open-ended,B00BMFIXOW,1-Jul-14,1404198000,What kind of gameplay should I expect from this?,,If you are familiar with the series then you will have a pretty good idea. Combat mechanics have not changed much. Its a little more fluent. Better weapon selections. As well as armors. Naval combat and exploration is a much improvement over its previous release of AC3. All in all a great buy. If your interested in trophies/achievements there is a lil more of a challenge. I was able to get the platinum trophies on all previous games fairly easy on one play threw. This one took me atleast 2 to obtain all including the platinum.

I really don't think 3rd person mp can exist in an industry of fps shooters. If it was like gta's mp. I'm sure they'd be better off. Co-op would be a better choice. Mp matches in ac is dismal as well. Hopefully this answers your question

This adapter causes the Wii U to recognize the controller as a Classic Controller, and some liberties had to be taken in order to make this happen. For example, the shoulder buttons on the Cube Controller are pressure sensitive and the Classic Controller's are not, so this adapter will not read the degree of pressure you're putting on the shoulder buttons. You have to press the GameCube Controller's shoulder buttons all the way down in order for the console to recognize it as a button press. For a more faithful and high quality adapter, I recommend the official adapter (the one with four Controller ports that plugs into the Wii U's USBs). I own both and after using the official one, I'm never going back to using the Mayflash one."

Instead, this adapter makes the Wii U read GameCube Controllers as if they were Wii Classic Controllers. As far as I know, that's its only function. So if your dance mat has a GameCube plug, AND if the game itself USES the Wii Classic Controller as a control scheme (meaning the game allows you to play songs or do dances with the Classic Controller alone), then it's possible it could work. But I'm not familiar with any game that has that function."

I'm asking because it looks like it's very easy to clean if the keys aren't inside something.,?,"The design of the keys aren't like traditional keyboards where you push down a key, and it goes below some hole. On the K70, the aluminum plate you see IS the bottom plate for all the keys. Not only does this design allow for easy cleaning, but the way the back light LEDS shine will also be reflected off of the aluminum body, giving it a very nice glow under/around each key. I spilled a drop or 2 of orange juice on the keyboard the first day i got it, and it landed not on top of any keys but rather under them. I simply used the included key puller and removed the keys near the spillage, and cleaned it up real easy."

yes/no,B00CD1FC6G,18-May-14,1400396400,Does this board still have the LED Issues? (Them dying off after a month or two),?,I too read the reports and was concerned about this. I'm happy to report that after 6 months of use all is still working well. Corsair was aware of the issue and it appears they have adjusted their manufacturing accordingly.
open-ended,B00CD1FC6G,7-Sep-14,1410073200,Corsair Vengeance K70 or CM Storm QuickFire TK?,,"That is a difficult question, since the form factor differs on the two. Not quite comparing apples to apples. I looked up the CM Storm QuickFire TK and I see they incorporated the DLT-PrtScn-Arrow Key section as 2nd Functions into the Numpad area. This smaller form factor decreases the distance between your left and right hand and may be more comfortable for your shoulders, or that's atleast the idea. I haven't owned a smaller form factor keyboard myself. Form factor wise it would be better to compare the K65 with the CM Storm QuickFire TK. The QuickFire TK would win hands down, because of a lack of features on the K65- no wrist rest, back-lighting, etc. The K70 has a very nice volume controller on the keyboard and dedicated media keys, but if you don't use media keys that often or if you do, but don't mind using them as a 2nd Function, it doesn't matter that much not having them as dedicated keys. The K70 has a very nice wrist rest and this may sound stupid, but this wins high points for me with the K70, since when I use a desktop keyboard really alot, I get keyboard wrist inflammation, if that is even a term. I bought a wrist gel (3M make for both my keyboard and mouse) months before I decided on which mechanical keyboard I was going to buy so that I wouldn't prefer one over the other just because of this add-on and so that I would have one if I decided to go with a keyboard without one. I used that gel wrist rest with my mouse, and it worked for a decent amount of months to stop the small frequent friction of my wrist against the mousepad/wooden table, but then I started to get a lasting pain a little higher up in my wrist because of the declining position I had to hold my wrist in to use the mouse with the wrist rest. That said, I have no problems with the K70 wrist rest, and that just shows how well designed it is and how even if you buy a separate wrist rest, it will probably not be as comfortable as the one provided with the K70. Subjectively for me, I would go with the K70 instead of the CM Storm QuickFire TK, since I enjoy the dedicated media keys and volume controller and its wrist rest. At the time I bought my K70, only the cherry mx red version was available. I would advise you to go with the cherry mx brown version out now since it has a little bit of a tactile feedback. Also, get yourself some rubber o-rings from amazon that reduces the key travel by supposedly 2mm and reduces bottoming out noise. I use it myself, trust me, it works very well. You might want to wait if you want more back-light color options on your keyboard since the corsair K70 RGB is almost out (all though only with cherry mx red keys at the moment, I would advise cherry mx browns, like I said). It gives you options to all the colors of the rainbow and more. It cost $40 more than the regular K70 version, so it's up to you if it is worth the cost. If you have to go for a keyboard now, I would say get the corsair K70 cherry mx brown. I also use the textured key-caps W, S and D, not the A since it is curved to the left and for the purposes I use it, I don't find it comfortable. These textured key-caps are quite nice for a little extra tactile feel."
open-ended,B00CD1FC6G,9-Sep-14,1410246000,What dose the BIOS switch do on the top of the keyboard?,,"The BIOS switch both adjusts the polling rate and allows you to turn off advanced keyboard features for compatibility with certain motherboard BIOS and KVM switches. Settings of 1, 2, 4, and 8 are millisecond polling rates (1ms = 1000hz). Switching to BIOS reduces the polling rate and turns off other features for maximum compatibility. By default we ship at 1ms (1000Hz) and most gamers will prefer to just use the setting. from http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=118655"

Small differences like ball physics tweaks are new but are only going to cause issues if you're very familiar with an old FIFA title. But I find this one to be easier than 11 for example and very similar to 13. The learning curve is not steep in my opinion. If you've never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice you'll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game"

open-ended,B00CJ7IUI6,21-Jul-14,1405926000,i have regular skyrim i want to know if you buy it will you get to keep your save?,,Absolutely. Your character and progress stay as they are and you can continue through both expansion packs.
yes/no,B00CJ7IUI6,25-Oct-14,1414220400,Does it require internet?,?,No.only for updates
open-ended,B00CJ7IUI6,2-Oct-14,1412233200,Is the DLC in the disc or is it a download code?,,"Skyrim Legendary edition has all 3 DLCs on the disc. In the PS3 menu, you will see the icon for Skyrim, then just below it will be the icon for the DLCs. Select that icon and it will take you into a menu showing the DLCs and you can choose which ones you want to install, and it also gives you options as to which language version to install. It is best to choose the language that matches the region code of the PS3, such as English version DLC for North American region code PS3. The disc will install the DLCs to the PS3's hard drive, then I believe it will require a restart of the system. Once that is done, you can then play Skyrim as usual. The extra icon for the DLCs will still be there below the Skyrim one, in case for any reason you wish to uninstall a DLC. You can install the DLCs and then play any saved game files that were made before installing the DLCs. If your character in the saved file meets certain criteria for triggering the DLC content, such as having fought the first dragon at the Western Watchtower, then the next time you fast travel you will likely encounter the Cultists. It is possible to have the cultists and Durak approach you at the same time, if you are over level 10 and have completed the quest Dragon Rising. If this occurs, they tend to talk over each other which can be confusing. As for Hearthfire, the sites of the new homes will have changed slightly, usually including a wood chopping block and some landscape like boulders or fallen trees may have been shifted. Also, the stone quarries and clay deposits available across Skyrim will have appeared and you will be able to mine them with a pickaxe. Also, the clothing, armor, and appearance of vampires will have changed if you have Dawnguard installed."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUI6,1-Oct-14,1412146800,Is there a difference between the game if I buy it new or i can just buy a used?,,No difference at all. Make sure if you want all the downloadable content that you buy the LEGENDARY EDITION.
yes/no,B00CJ7IUI6,21-Nov-14,1416556800,Will this play on a PS4?,N,No
open-ended,B00CJ7IUI6,29-Nov-14,1417248000,"What is the biggest difference between this legendary edition and the greatest hits version? if I just want to play the game, which version is best?",,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition is the best version to get because it comes with all DLC released for the game.

open-ended,B00CJ7IUGS,31-May-14,1401519600,How much space do the DLCs take up on the hard drive once they've been installed?,,"In all it took 1.5 gigs, so nothing to really worry about taking up space."
yes/no,B00CJ7IUGS,3-Jun-14,1401778800,Do I have to start a fresh game to play the DLC? I have a level 12 character and I don't want to start from scratch.,?,"No, all of the content can be played going forward. If you were level 40 or above it might not be as fun but that's a low enough level it will be no problem."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUGS,28-Nov-14,1417161600,What is the difference between the Legendary Edition and the other one?,,The Legendary edition has all of the DLC content that was ever released for Skyrim. I would definitely go with this version of the game.
open-ended,B00CJ7IUGS,24-Dec-14,1419408000,Why the m rating?,,"If you really explore everything there is to offer in the game, it can get Mature. For an average player just playing the game it shouldn't be a problem. However if you try really hard you can encounter some Gore in battles and in cut scenes, you can experience some really cartoony drug/alcohol use, There is some language, and down right immoral values through out. However, I have played for hours and never seen anything sexual about the game at all."
yes/no,B00CJ7IUGS,31-Jul-14,1406790000,Are the bugs worked out? Last time I played on the DLC I had duplicate NPCS in my custom house and I'd encounter duplicate mobs,?,"Thats strange, surprisingly this is pretty stable, I haven't had any issues with it, I don't know how long ago you played but they have done some updates to the game to help prevent bugs. I've encountered only one issue and that was my shield literally disappeared, like in the game I still had it and still blocked and moved like I had it but it was not visible and it wouldn't allow me to do any crafting, I restarted my system and booted up my save and it was fine. In any game this massive you will need be a little understanding of bugs. Some things pertaining to the game are hard to navigate like curing vampirism and such...some people just don't know those things so I'd do some googling on that kinda stuff. This is a great game and worth the buy though, I've had many many many hours of fun playing this game through again and still have not completed the DLC storys yet."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUGS,6-Feb-15,1423209600,If i buy a used version will i still get all the DLC?,,"As long as it is legendary edition of skyrim, with the 2 discs. 1 disc being the actual game disc and the second disk being the DLC content. Used or new as long as you have those 2 discs"
open-ended,B00CJ7IUGS,21-Jun-14,1403334000,"It says ""Better with Kinect Sensor"" but is it really necessary?",,"Kinect is problematic, and you do not actually need it."
yes/no,B00CJ7IUGS,16-Apr-14,1397631600,Do I need to have played Oblivion to understand Skyrim?,?,"Not at all, the game does have some history based on the previous game but that doesn't matter to how you play at all and there it no character carry over like in mass effect. It will take you weeks to play all of the quests and find everything. Have fun!"
yes/no,B00CJ7IUGS,2 days ago,,Should I get the PC version if I don't really care for the Xbox controls?,?,"You can set your PC to use an xbox controller anyway, you can also tweak the console on PC, a big plus if you're really into the game!"
yes/no,B00CJ7IUIQ,19-Apr-14,1397890800,can i play this on the pc with an xbox 360 usb controller?,?,"Short answer: Yes. Long Answer: I just tested my Game Stop Brand Xbox 360 controller with usb converter on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, and it worked perfectly. I personally think the game is significantly easier to play with a keyboard and mouse, but yes, you are perfectly capable of playing with the controller. (Other operating systems may or may not work [I have no experience with Windows 8 nor previous versions]). If you have a different operating system, I recommend looking it up on google, or asking another person before you buy the game. P.S. If you need help setting up your controller, just let me know, or there may be tutorials online."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,31-Jul-14,1406790000,Does this legendary edition have the game on a disc that I can install or is it only a download client? I do not want to spend a week downloading,,"It has the base game, but it does not have any of the DLC on disk. You need to register the product code with Steam and then you can download the DLC."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,1-May-14,1398927600,if i buy the legendary edition do i need internet conection to activate it? if game needs autentification or updates im screwd,,"When I installed the game, I had to log into my steam acct and validate. It also had to download updates. After install, you can choose to play offline."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,16-Jun-14,1402902000,"Is this Legendary Edition an actual standalone version of Skyrim, or is it an add-on where I would need to buy the original game as well?",,This is the game plus the add-ons. You don't need to buy anything else. Just make sure you have a Steam account.
yes/no,B00CJ7IUIQ,22-Jul-14,1406012400,is it compatible to windows 8?,Y,"Yes, I currently run mine on Windows 8."

open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,8-Dec-14,1418025600,"I want to buy this for my 14 year old son for Christmas. However, I'm confused by the PC download vs. the PC version. Which is the way to go?",,"PC - Download, its a digital code that you redeem on steam, you will have to then download the whole game. PC - Version it the game itself on DVD."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,15-Mar-15,1426402800,Does the pc version come on a disk with the DLCs? or are the DLCs on a code? thank you,,"It comes without the DLCs. The PC version comes with a CD and a code. The game is in the CD, but you'll have to look on the internet on how to install it with no need to download the game from Steam and save time, if your network is crappy. Once downloaded/installed, download the DLCs directly from steam, with the code."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,10-Mar-15,1425970800,this game is a STEAM game or its a normal game?,,"You can redeem it on steam. If it takes 14hrs to download, then your internet is way too slow."
open-ended,B00CJ7IUIQ,30-Sep-14,1412060400,Does the PC disc have the code in a paper or in the disk? I don't have DVD reader and the disc version is cheaper than the PC download code. Thanks,,"Yes, it has the code in a paper! It will also automatically seek out Steam if you have it on your computer to download to your Steam library. I highly recommend going this route."
yes/no,B00CJD4HD2,28-Mar-14,1395990000,Can the scroll wheel move left and right?,?,The wheel clicks left and right so I suppose you could program it to the arrows.
yes/no,B00CJD4HD2,11-Jan-14,1389427200,"Does this mouse work on Mac? I would assume so, but it only mentions Windows operating systems in the description.",Y,Yes it does now. Logitech released drivers for Mac a little while ago. Works fringe for me on my MBP.

Especially regarding the mouse-wheel/middle-mouse button problem. Still not as good as the G5, but it's worked well for me so far."
open-ended,B00CJD4HD2,25-Nov-13,1385366400,I ordered this G500 mouse and it is making a high pitched tone that is giving me a headache after 4 hours of use. Return or try to replace?,,I'd replace it. If had one for several weeks which I use for about 10 hours per day. It's been great so far with no humming noise!
open-ended,B00CJD4HD2,6-Mar-14,1394092800,Odd question but how loud are the button clicks for this mouse? I.e. would it annoy anyone sleeping in the same room as you? Or one room over?,,no the button clicks are normal. Be advised though that with any mouse in a high intensity clicking game (Diablo for one) the clicking can become problematic. One thing to be advised about is the mouse wheel. This puppy can spin fast and when you have it do measured option it can get really loud. Without the measured option on though it is noiseless. Side buttons and top buttons are near silent.

Looking to program keys on G13 and buttons on G500s to be ""macros"" or keystrokes.",,"I have that exact setup, and you can program the g-keys individually using Logitech's gaming software across multiple Logitech peripherals. It doesn't matter if you have a G1 on the G13 and a G1 on the mouse, when you program them, they are programmed based on what device the key is physically on. So you can program G1 on the G13 to execute a macro, and G1 on the mouse to emulate a function key, for example."
yes/no,B00CJD4HD2,10-Apr-14,1397113200,does the button on the side with the red dot do anything on this one? g500 it was just a dead button,Y,"By default it's just a generic programmable button. I set it to act as the mouse wheel click, because I don't like clicking the mouse wheel. You can set it to practically anything you want through the software though, like keystrokes or macros. Hope that helps!"

open-ended,B00CMC6HZ6,3-Nov-14,1415001600,"Does this have online VS? Also, can you do 4 player online matches?",,"Probably, I didn't really play the online yet myself, I'm sure other people know the answer, I just basically reviewed it based on the gameplay, animations, speed, graphics, roster, features, controls etc. based on my opinion, I don't know much about the online aspect even though I do have XBOX Live but the really cool part of this game if you have XBOX Live that I do know is downloading the created wrestlers that people made that aren't in the game, that's pretty awesome and I like that, of course its better if they make them in the game but if they don't you can download peoples creations but I didn't really play online myself and from what I hear about the new WWE 2K15 at least the XBOX 360 version that just came out is that it's really not impressive at all even though people had high hopes for it cause the roster is smaller plus they didn't really make much improvements and they took out other features and only improved on a couple things so 2K15 lost more than it gained this year I have read on the XBOX 360 anyways, the only really good thing about it is the addition of Sting which is awesome of course cause he's a legend and really popular but supposedly they are going to have more improvements for the XBOX ONE and PS4 Versions when those versions come out soon and they want everyone to buy a new system which is kindof sad, in my view if they put out a new game they should make it as good as possible on all systems or not even release it so 2K14 is probably better to buy if you have a 360 and not a XBOX ONE or PS4 in my view plus it's way cheaper now in comparison and you can download created versions of Sting anyways and all the other packs of wrestlers that you can buy so the roster can be really big with a lot of legends and current guys, no game has everyone that you want but 2K14 comes pretty close roster wise, hopefully 2K15 will be better on the new systems cause I heard it's underwhelming on the 360 but 2K14 is alright, good roster, lots of features but the movements of the wrestlers, controls, speed, gameplay etc. TO ME could be a lot better like the N64 games they had a lot better gamplay to me, if they could make modern day versions of wrestling games with a grapple system like No Mercy or Wrestlemania 2000 from the N64 it would be AWESOME!"

Then you'll find it under the ""My Games"" section on Origin click on the game and it should give you the option to download. Hope this helps."

open-ended,B00CRL9TU2,10-Jun-14,1402383600,I recently had to give my GT5 disc back to my friend and was wondering if GT6 was worth the extra 20 bucks. And is it more realistic then GT5?,,"Play Station has stopped supporting the on line races that they used to provide every month in GT5. I would buy a used GT6 game if you like the time trials. GT6 did not provide any extra races on the online part like GT5 did other than stupid time trials. I thought it was easier to tune your cars in GT5 and had over 700 cars that I owned. GT6 is harder to earn lots of money and there isn't many cars that you can win. (maybe 20) I haven't played it in several months as I got bored with it, something that didn't happen with GT5. If you have a large garage full of cars with GT5 then it would be good to own it again if you can buy it at a decent price. The racing dynamics are not noticeably better with GT6 and some think it is actually worse than GT5. I know Sony is still tweaking it to make it better like they did with GT5. It might be worth while to get it if you can buy it cheap. Certainly not $50 like I paid for it when it came out. Maybe 25 to 30 dollars would be reasonable. Hope this helped you."

While you're not consistantly selecting tracks to race on, it's more like having all the tracks combined into one seemingly cohesive environment, which you can either drive to yourself or ""jump"" to from your Hideout/Command Post. To be honest, it is what you want it to be; if you like more arcade-style racing where you go race to race, do that. If you want to just drive around until you find something you fancy, you can do that too. The nice thing that makes Rivals so compatable with different player types is that it allows you to make the game what you will. Don't like free roam? Don't free roam. Want to drive around challenging other racers head-to-head or messing with cops because you can? You can do that too."

Is RS an option for someone over (ahem) 50?",Y,"Absolutely. I loath video games and am by no means a gamer, but I love playing Rocksmith. You can set the level for absolute beginner or advanced player. One great feature is that you have the option of picking a song and playing it over and over. With each pass, the game will get just a little more difficult and pull you closer to mastery. A second great feature is the simple arcade type game feature. Here you can play simple games that will focus on a number of technique elements including chords, scales, picking, sliding, etc. As a music student enrolled in a guitar program, I can't recommend this game highly enough."
open-ended,B00D6PTMHI,1-Dec-14,1417420800,"Will this enable a person to read music and play other pieces, or do you only learn the songs included?",,"This game actually teaches you the cords so you could pick up other songs and play them after you get good at this game.

open-ended,B00D6PTMB4,24-Jun-14,1403593200,I am a beginner at guitar and recently bought this game. Does anyone know if there is a tutorial section on finger posturing?,,Yes there is. I knew nothing when I started with the original Rocksmith and this version is much improved. In both they show you everything even down to the names of each part of the guitar. They also have lessons on basic stuff that'll be useful in many songs you play later. I highly recommend this. You'll see results ONLY if you put in time every week. Every day would be even better.
yes/no,B00D6PTMB4,31-May-14,1401519600,"rocksmith 2012 or 2014, $40 price difference. Is it worth the cash to get the newer version?",Y,Honestly yes it is worth it. You get ALOT more content on the new one and the second one is more of an upgrade to the Rocksmith product rather than just a sequel. Definitely get the new one you won't regret it
open-ended,B00D6PTMB4,8-May-14,1399532400,Could someone suggest a good guitar to use this with? Something cheap yet not horrible and sold on Amazon?

yes/no,B00D6PTMB4,15-Jun-14,1402815600,Does it come with the guitar?,?,"The actual game will only come with an air guitar, this guitar will only exist in your imagination and does not plug into any systems but your mind (advantage is calibration is not required and neither is tuning). For a physical guitar you can either buy the guitar and video game bundle or purchase the game and guitar separately."
open-ended,B00D6PTMB4,15-Oct-14,1413356400,how long is the cable?,,7-8 foot you can get a double female and another guitar cable from a music store and go all over the house

I have a version of the Xbox without the hard drive.,N,If your cloud has space then a hard drive would not be needed. I so far have only saved progress so that would be handled by the cloud system. If you do not wish to get a hard drive and want a physical copy of the files then saving to a flash drive inserted into the console is possible.

open-ended,B00D6PTMSW,16-Jul-14,1405494000,What elements of the game does Kinect enhance? It says it is better but not required to play with Kinect. How?,,When I tried using the Kinect I found that it picked up hand motions only causing confusion. I'm sure it works better for some and I was looking forward to never having to take my hands off the guitar but it didn't work out for me.
yes/no,B00D6PTMSW,19-Jun-14,1403161200,Does the game help you tune your guitar?,Y,"Only when you're playing it. Once it's in tune, based on the quality of your guitar, it should stay tuned. To that key anyway. When I change key in the game it automatically prompts me to tune it and the tuning feature is actually quite helpful. Usually takes less than a minute with my guitar. Hope that helped."
open-ended,B00D6PTMSW,29-Sep-14,1411974000,Aside from the game and guitar is there anything else you need to purchase?

yes/no,B00D6PTMSW,5 days ago,,I have an xbox360 with only 4gb of hard drive. Can this game be played directly from the Disc without requiring game installation in the hard drive?,Y,Yes it can. At least I never installed it. You will need memory to save of course.

There isn't really any noticeable insufficienties with it, but it is a little high for just to play minecraft.

Has anyone tried it to confirm it fits?,,"I've taken my pouch to gamestop to when they had n3ds xl to demo. It fit perfectly fine, even with a bit of wiggle room.

From how I have used it, I put the 3ds in the big pouch and there is plenty of room in the middle of the case for other items, such as cleaning cloths, the charger, or another small case for more games. It's up to you. I hope this helps : )"

The back one is the snug one and fits the 3DS XL perfectly without a strap on it. The front section is exposed a bit more and currently holds my MH4 Card case perfectly. It can also hold the charger, headphones and other items of you choose to have a smaller card care (or don't take one at all). Hope this helps."

The Phantom is newer and should have slightly better specifications, like the processor is much faster, but you are unlikely to notice too much difference. It may come down to which color scheme you prefer. They are both compatible with an Xbox One if you get an adapter, and with the PS4, but you need to purchase a talkback cable for the Tango while that cable comes with the Phantom.

One word of caution: the controller currently converts game audio to stereo (NOT surround sound). There may be a patch to fix this in the future, but who knows. There are 2 icons on the left of the adapter...the top is the controller icon that controls the game volume, the bottom is a person icon that controls the chat party volume. If you hold the chat icon for a couple seconds, it will mute the game volume; if you just tap one or the other, you can volume up or down the selected line."

If you want one of the Turtle Beach adapters, which add features like mic monitoring and Bass Boost and other presets you should look at the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, or the Call of Duty Sentinel Task Force or Call of Duty Sentinel Prestige.

Sound is very good in my opinion these are better than the more pricey headsets out right now. The mixer is a bit of a pain to use though depending on what platform you'll be using these on.

The issue with this is that you must sit directly in front of your tv because the split in the cord is so short. I mostly use them with my laptop. I have been meaning to test if it is necessary to plug the jack into the controller. If it does work without that, then these work great with the PS4!"
yes/no,B00D96BPL0,6-Dec-14,1417852800,Does this work on the Wii U?,Y,"Yes, if you use it without the inline amp it will work fine"

open-ended,B00D96BPL0,19-Dec-14,1418976000,Anyone knows if it works on a wii u?,,"Yes it will work on a Wii U. Just unplug the headset from the inline amp and plug it directly into the Wii U's 3.5mm audio port. Easy Peasy. The Marvel Seven is a great headset, I actually use one at my desk every day for phone calls and video chat."

open-ended,B00D96BPL0,8-Nov-14,1415433600,How comfortable is this headset? What about the sound quality?,,Comfort is good you just have to break them in first. They were tight on me out of the box but after a few nights of leaving them extended on a box that wasn't an issue. But comfort is really dependent on your opinion and preference. Sound is very good in my opinion these are better than the more pricey headsets out right now. The mixer is a bit of a pain to use though depending on what platform you'll be using these on. I got these for the PC and have to change some settings to get them to work properly. Lately I have been using them on the PS4 except the mixer will not work at all for me. Just the headset itself plugged into the controller works fine though.

There are larger ones now available, and I'd guess other brands are just as good. In fact, my drive had nothing that identified it as a ""Hausbell"" drive -the drive looked totally generic. Note that this and other drives advertised and/or labeled as for the Slim, work fine on the 360E because the octagonal slots are identical."

Is there some kind of adaptor you can buy ?,,"This is worded kind of difficult for me to understand, but if you are talking about the simple headset that plugs into the controller, there is no need for an adapter.

yes/no,B00DB9JYFY,13-Apr-14,1397372400,Does this have singleplayer?,N,"No, it does not... it's the first that I've ever experienced a game like this - everything you do is online/multiplayer; however, there are the following features that give you the 'single player' experience. 1) Small Squads - the online players make up about 10 of the soldiers that are fighting on the field; there are dozens of 'grunts' and 'spectres' which are part of the program (much easier to kill like in traditional single player modes). They balance it out with the 'live players' so it's a good mix. 2) There is a traditional 'campaign' mode that you can play from start to finish, but again, it's always online and there's always 'live' players mixed in with the computer enemies. 3) The developer rolled out their new enhanced 'match making' algorithm which takes the learning curve frustrations out of the way, i.e. as you get better, they match you with better players and visa versa. There's a 'training' section but that's super basic stuff. The game is just awesome... your pilots are outfitted with special jump kits so, in addition to walking, running, sprinting, etc. you can jump and get these little jet powered boosts... and there's the ability to perform special wall running/jumping moves that changes the shooter landscape completely.. Hope that helps..."

yes/no,B00DBDPOZ4,1-Oct-14,1412146800,Is this product essentially the same as putting 2 aa rechargeable batteries into the controller and just plugging a micro usb until charged?,N,"No. I'm not sure what kind of rechargeable batteries you have, but I have tried this before with the energizer rechargeable batteries and it doesn't work because you can only charge them with the charger case thing that comes with the batteries. I'm guessing this can be applied to all rechargeable batteries. For some reason the usb charger won't recognize the batteries, and if they do charge it is a lie! Maybe this didn't work for just me, byt it's better if you just buy the battery pack. Much longer battery life."

The music that people use to deter others from playing only appear in the early stages of the game and only once, yet they continue to ignorantly dismiss the rest of the soundtrack and thus the entire game itself in some sort of backwards thinking. The music is remixed like the usual fashion of Mario World and the original Yoshi's Island, it's very cheery, calming, or exciting depending on the level. The only way to know for sure how the music is, is to play the games itself because the music is all made to accompany the levels and they flow quite nicely together."

You cannot play offline and the campaigns are just multiplayer games with a set map progression. Therefore if you are looking for a 'single player experience' this game does not have it.

It's a shooter so of course there will be blood and violence, but it's nothing that'll traumatize him. As for language, he probably hears worse things during recess at school."

I cannot speak for Amazon however I'm pretty sure based on your location and the type of order that you will receive the correct version based on the address of your primary account information. If there is a problem with your order once received, I would leave the plastic wrapping on, contact amazon customer service, and exchange it for the correct format."

Is there a way to turn off blood / gore for PC version?,?,"Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no option to turn off blood and gore, however the worst thing that will be witnessed is a 2 second scene that occurs when a Titan crushes a pilot. All you see during this move is a misty red cloud. Aside from that the game is actually pretty clean."
open-ended,B00DC9T2J6,22-Apr-14,1398150000,Wondering how you play this game on a desktop PC? Do you use a wireless controller or a keyboard and mouse?

Although you can play with a controller you might be at a disadvantage though.

It has a different storyline and is not connected to the others.

Can I use my FF XIV PS3 paid subscription on my PS4 system, or do I need two subscriptions?",,"You only need to pay one monthly subscription for the account, regardless of how many systems you use with that account, but you do need a PS4 copy of the game added to your account. As an existing PS3 user, you have two options: 1) You can purchase a PS4 copy of the game and register that copy to your existing Square Enix account (the same one you use from PS3). This would then allow you to log into the game from either system, your PS3 or PS4. As this involves another purchase of the game, you would also receive another 30 days of subscription time ""free"" (which is their way of saying ""included with the purchase price"") or 2) You can transfer your existing PS3 service to PS4. To do this, log into your Square Enix account at the MogStation, select ""Playstation4 Upgrade"", and follow the prompts. This transfer is free of charge (until the end of 2014), but once the transfer is complete, you would no longer be able to log in to the game from your PS3. (And since there's no additional purchase with this option, there's no additional 30 days, either.)"

open-ended,B00DCBDNW6,15-Apr-15,1429081200,"If I own the pc version, and decide to buy the ps4 version can I still play my with same account from the pc version?",,"You can play in any of the systems with your character and data, the only thing that is required is the license (code) for that system. same will apply with the expansion when its released. So to answer your question yes if you have Final Fantasy XIV ARR for PC and you buy the game for PS4 you can play on both systems."

I only use accelerator hand brake/park brake and one of the toggle buttons for screen changes. there are other buttons but my game is 12 years old and has no use for them. I like the suction cups and do not use the clamps because they hit my knees under the slide out table (keyboard slider board under the desk) that i set the unit on. I bought for the price and was expecting crap but am very happy with it.

open-ended,B00DH1KRQQ,28-Dec-13,1388217600,how is this controller for playing lego lord of the rings pc game,,"This controller is one of the best I have ever purchased, but if you need to modify the button layout because you find it uncomfortable or counter-intuitive there are a few programs that will modify the button layout. For example, x360ce is a very simple program to use (I use it for all of my games). It forces the game to think that the controller is an Xbox 360 controller so it is compatible with any and all games that use that controller as it's primary means. Just drop it in the folder with the LEGO LOTR executable (.exe) and run it, basically. Note: This program is not endorsed by Amazon. Beyond that, this controller feels a lot like a PS2 controller. So if you like that ""feel,"" you'll love this controller."

Someone else might be able to help you with that. There are a few free ones around the Internet, like joy2key, but I haven't used them personally.

Its somewhat quieter than most and definitly quieter than just about every keyboard I have owned but you will eventually not even hear it all after a short while.

But some games have been rereleased as a game for DS. Example the classic sonic the hedgehog games got released as ""sonic classics"" a DS tittle. ""Namco museum DS"" is another good DS game, it rereleases old arcade games like ""galega"" and "" Pac-Man""."

If you bought them from a normal local vendor (one based in the US), they will almost surely be from that region. However, if you buy them from a pawn shop or from a person, it is possible they won't be. This has never been an issue for me since the dawn of video games. I do suggest that you simply be careful when purchasing games on websites that are completely in another language as it is very likely the games will be from another region. My brother made that mistake and assumed the game would work on his English version console. Considering that the game was only released in Japan though, it should have been obvious."

The head set plugs into the controller for power no batteries for the head set. But the part that plugs into the controller has a 3.5 plug on.

It's a solid mouse for the money though. What I can tell you as far as weight is concerned is that it's seems slightly back heavy (perhaps because of the ""balance ring"" which is the thumb catch towards the back), but for the most part pretty well balanced. My only real complaint is that I wish they would've elongated the ""balance ring (thumb catch)"" a little more. I find myself sometimes sort of running over my thumb with this.

However you are doing a great job at parenting seeking help first before buying him a game. I think it is rated mature. I would say let him play it 12-16yr olds i think should handle it just as well as a 17yr old. Ive played mature games since i was a young kid and theres nothing wrong with zombie games for a 12 yr old. If youre a really cautious parent though then no he would need to wait a few more yesrs

Is there a thumb button below the joypad?",,"The fit is almost exactly the same. The palm rest comes a little further out for large hands that. They removed the wheel and gave you a button, which matches up with most games giving you 12 action buttons and then you still have room for Shift/Ctrl/Alt on the pinky side. The buttons feel the same as the TE, they aren't mechanical like the Orbweaver, but they are responsive. Yes there still is a thumb button above the ""hat"" joystick and a thumb paddle button below it (hard to see in pictures). It seems that Razer also improved the software somewhat over the N52TE with one exception - we lost the ""repeat until another button it pressed"" macro action. So you have to toggle on/off macros now. Maybe they will fix that in a future release."

By no means trash a keyboard for this, it's purely meant for a more ergonomic input method. As for the wired/wireless, there are tradeoffs. Personally wired is more reliable, no battery to worry about and no wonky connection issues to deal with. But if you can't configure it to be somewhere comfortable for you within the reach of the wire, that's what wireless is for. Be advised that any wireless device will have at least a tiny bit of lagged input to the computer, so it's not advised for anything competitive."

open-ended,B00EI4V3X2,5-Apr-15,1428217200,Is this headset surround sound for both PS3 and PS4?

It has a feature to automatically adjust chat volume according to the sound signal, ie what's going on in the game. So if youre in a loud cinematic in game moment, the chat will also j crease in volume. I turn the sound down most of the time unless I'm gaming alone. I personally I don't like the feature because it sounds like people are uelling in your ear when the music gets loud"
open-ended,B00EI4V3X2,25-Oct-14,1414220400,Is it possible to listen to music or videos on a laptop using Bluetooth connection only?,,Yes you can. You will need to sync the headphones to the laptop.

Is there a way to hear both anyone is aware of?,Y,"So, I deleted my earlier post. Getting 2 audio sources to play simultaneously is actually pretty easy. The mixamp has a line in for spdif (optical) and your typical aux 3.5mm jack. I hooked my computer via spdif and my TV via aux. You'll get both AND be able to toggle the balance with the right earcup game/VoIP switch. (I initially thought it didn't work, as I was 100% to my computer source, hence my deleted answer. Don't make my mistake). I would recommend the spdif from your console and aux from your computer, you'll get better in game sound. The balance feature is really nice, and it is tailored to your exact needs."

yes/no,B00ENFVJJO,16-Jan-15,1421395200,Does anyone feel it charges to fast causing the controller to NOT hold a charge as long as it may have before using this charger?,?,"I haven't used any other chargers, so it is hard to compare, but this is my personal observations so far (2 months of use): I have not noticed any decrease in charge capacity after use. Typically mine will charge from 1/3 to full capacity of controler in 1.5 to 2 hours, this doesn't seem to be too fast."

How could I get warranty claims if something does't work here in germany, do the german games fit into the U.S. version ?",?,"Nintendo, like many other purveyors of electronic media, enforce a region lock on many of their systems and games.

Of course it will work for God of War, it's just a standard PS3 controller. The buttons are incredibly responsive. The d-pad especially is wonderful, although I'd expect you won't use that if GOW. The face buttons have nice rounded edges which is great for standard beat-em-up fare like rapid square/triangle combos. I have a callus on my thumb from playing Castle Crashers on a stock PS3 controller. The HORI works much better for me."
yes/no,B00EOI2MRS,30-Jan-15,1422604800,Does it work with steam on pc?,?,"Mostly yes, that's more game-specific, you'll probly want an external remapping app such as joy2key or Xpadder for some games."

open-ended,B00EOPT5ZS,5-Oct-14,1412492400,"Can you press 2 buttons at the same time?, for instance up + left?",,"No, it only accepts on key press at a time at a time. There are some games or software where it's quite handy (at replacing those awkward key reaches for crouching, ducking, throwing a grenade, or swapping weapons) there are other games (WASD) where it's not as useful for steerage. It can do dual-key commands, but sadly it does not do macros. It's a niche product and takes a little bit of a learning curve to train yourself to use it. It's a very sturdy product that uses Cherry keys and will likely outlive me, but I do not use it in all situations."
yes/no,B00EOPT5ZS,2-Mar-15,1425283200,Is it possible to bind the Windows Volume control to this? One YouTube review said it cannot be done.,?,"I think it is possible. One switch to increase and one to decrease volume. However, figuring out which keys to bind may be tricky."
open-ended,B00EOPT5ZS,16-Dec-14,1418716800,"Does this support click and hold? If I want to map it to Vent/Mumble push to talk button, can I keep it depressed to keep talking?",,"Yes, it does. It uses MX Cherry switches, so internally it works just like a keyboard."

open-ended,B00EOPT5ZS,12-Oct-14,1413097200,"Does this work for regular computer/office uses? In other words, not for gaming but for ergonomics when using computer keyboard heavily?",,Sure. The driver is always loaded. You can bind the four switches to anything you like.

open-ended,B00EPIG606,15-Aug-14,1408086000,We have only been able to play the 1st of the 5 episodes. How do we access the other 4?,,"It depends on what format you are playing it on. For me, I was playing it on Playstation 3. I know that it gives you episode 1 for free on the IOS app as well as Android, and then after that you have to pay either $5 per additional episode or you can buy the season pass, which I believe is $19.99 which also includes the 400 Days bonus episode.

I have tried it on wood (desk), vinyl (like a fold out table surface), plastic (video game case), my razer mouse pad, and on my bed all seem to have little effect. I will say this though that it seems most important that the surface is smooth/flat. Let me know if you would like to know anything else!"
open-ended,B00EWEHI5K,11-Dec-14,1418284800,What frequency/system does the wireless use? (bluetooth/rf/etc),,"It does not use bluetooth. It has a dongle that is built into the charging stand, which has a micro usb port. A usb cable with a micro usb male tip and regular usb female tip is included. The usb cable pulgs into the charging tower and the pc: this setup is for wireless mouse use. For wired use, the usb cable plugs directly to the mouse and the pc: this setup unpowers the charging stand, but the mouse is being charged by the cable. Not sure what frequency the wireless connection is, but the response time is nearly identical to the wired setup. I dont play FPS games, so I may not be aware of any differences that other programs or games would allow me to notice. As for other games, drawing and painting, designing etc, I cannot physically tell the difference between wired and wireless modes."

Hope this helps!"
open-ended,B00EWEHI5K,2-Dec-14,1417507200,Should I get this or the Logitech G502 Proteus Core?,,"It depends. I know the Razer Ouroboros is a great product because I use it every single day. I have not used the Logitech mouse so I can't really compare the two. They Razer mouse is more adaptable if you are left handed than most computer mice. It has a very different button layout than the Logitech though. So, it depends on how often you use the additional buttons (other than the left and right click and the mouse wheel, which are now pretty standard inclusions). If you use them often you will want to consider which ones you will be more comfortable using. I do like the stabilizing wings on the Razer mouse, which the Logitech does not appear to have. I don't know that I have helped much, but they are two very different mice and I don't know nearly enough about the Logitech to give you a better answer."

(assuming they ever unlock all the games) I just want to stream my Vita to the TV like I do with my PSP.,,"PS Vita TV is a stand alone high definition console version that connects to your television. It will not stream from a PS Vita handheld system! The Japanese PS Vita TV system is very limited in the US with most games and app service not able to operate. YouTube will not work work on a PS Vita tv , but works on a Vita handheld system! Crazy!!! You have to have a Japanese Playstation account to use it!! No option to connect a US account! An US version is going to be released in October 2014 and hopefully open all the locked out apps and games. It will stream video and games from a Playstion 4 console, but seem to lose connection quite a bit for me. Hopefully after the US release all these problems will be worked out. The system has great potential, but Sony seems to be holding it back and letting it die like the Vita handheld."

yes/no,B00F27JN8Q,11-Jun-14,1402470000,Can you use the vita itself as a controller for games such as Uncharted : Golden Abyss for this device ??,Y,"When you press the Left Analog Stick (L3) you'll see a hand with a finger pointing out, moving the analog while holding the O button simulates the front touch screen. The Right Analog Stick (R3) is for the back screen and when you press the other stick while in Touch Screen mode, you'll be touch both screens.

open-ended,B00F27JNGS,14-May-14,1400050800,is for television or what?,,"It is a screen-less PSVita. Think of it that way. It is a cross between a PS Vita and an AppleTV or similar. On the one hand, it is quite small and streams everything. On the other hand, the lack of a touch screen (and back screen) limits the number of Vita games it can play. However, it could stream your PS4 to another room (It will use a PS4 controller with the latest firmware). You will have to have a JPN PSN account to ropily set it up."

Until PS4 patches a third party Ian audio problem, you will have to use the plug to hardwire them into the controller. Cord goes from ""line in"" on headset to bottom audio jack on controller. The problem reportedly will be taken care of, but while it's not patched it doesn't allow for you to adjust Game-Chat audio OR the volume from the headset. You must use the settings on the ps4 menu to adjust volume and game-chat is standard. The only headset actually in full function with ps4 now that I know of is the PS4 gold headset, but with the patch on the way, this one is an obvious choice for me. Quality is amazing and super cool looking."

Searching this device and 8.1 drivers he has flooded a lot of forums, improperly. I have not one problem with this keyboard, except when playing around 3rd party's lightshow programs. I would have to uninstall Roccat Power Grid (optional software, that allows some lightshows and control through smartphone apps) and re-install drivers and firmware on the keyboard using Roccats updater and things work as normal as when I first got it. I have learned that most other lightshow programs and controls are outlived with support or just are not finished entirely to a well polished transition back to normal. But looking on Roccats website it does in fact support window 8 and further reading on forums indicate that people have been using it with windows 8.1 since driver Roccat 1.30 and firmware version 1.25.

I've had mine for quite a while now, and my fingers never come across touching or bumping the dongles (and I have large hands). I have never had an issue sliding them back into their base. They work amazingly. I wish I knew where I put the original packaging to see what the warranty was, but it will NEVER hurt to contact them and explain your situation. Nyko has been great about handling defective accessories. If you have the documents that came with the unit, contact them. If not, you probably can find their customer service connection on their website to address the situation. I hope this helps a little. ~C"

Some enemies require a ""heavy"" attack where you hold in ""X"" or ""Y"" and it will break their guard. You hit""B"" to do a roll move, which you will need to do for some enemies. It's a beautiful game though and the multiplayer is pretty fun if you have a friend to play with. Worth it if you can find it used."

They are selected with a button on the bottom of the Venus mouse. Each of the five different profiles (mode 1-5) has an indicator color which lights the scroll wheel. In the profile setup you have a series of five DPI presets each with a pair of sliders for x and y axis. Generally you would want the x-y to be parallel. But for a special program use you may want it slow left and right and fast up and down. In that case the x-y sliders would not be parallel. These are selected from within the current profile (mode) with the up-down arrows behind the scroll wheel. This will light up a series of 1 to 5 lights on the top of the mouse indicating which DPI setting you have engaged. You may like 5 lights but prefer a slower setting just pull the x-y sliders down to the desired setting in the 5th DPI."

Outside of being ten dollars cheaper and with a flanky weight system, what are the main differences between the two?",,"This is for sure the same mouse in a different body. The Perdition has the same weight system as well. If debating between the two mice I say it comes down to the cosmetics and the need for a thumb rest or not. Even the software for both mice are identical aside from the logo of course. I think I want them both, at such a low price point I don't see why not. What really gets me is this mouse info states it's been on Amazon since late 2013. Mind boggling as I've been looking for a true alternative to the G600 and Naga for such a long time now."
yes/no,B00FNKMVUO,26-Jul-14,1406358000,is the software user friendly?,Y,It is easy to start up and easy to use to set up the keys. The starting keys itself is already fine meaning you don't need to set up all your mouse bindings if you don't mind a standard mouse set up with the side keys 1-12 being hotkeys for the 1-12 numbers of your keyboard and if you want to change any of the bindings an image on the in software key set up will show you what option corresponds to what on your mouse making it really straight forward. Its been a super easy time using it in general.

Thanks!",,There is a quick button on the bottom of the mouse is cycles through the profiles in order. You can assign a color to each profile so you can easily see which one your on. You do have to pick it up to do it but I think you can also assign a button on the top of the mouse to switch profiles.

Mine can, howevr i do not now how much yours can hold. the mount is super light so really just take into consideration the weight of the kinnect and make your decision from there."

(Use Xbox fitness a lot and need it to see floor level.,,"The mount is only adjustable to make it sit on the TV properly. Once the Kinect is mounted, you can still tilt the sensor as you normally would, but your view range is dependent on the distance. I got the mount because my living room is smaller and putting it on my TV allowed it to see more of the room. Once you move it, you can recalibrate the sensor to the new position through the Kinect settings. In this sense it worked for me, but it depends on your set up. Does this help?"

yes/no,B00GHTP4ZY,6-May-14,1399359600,Does this game have multiplayer mode? My son and I would like to play together on the Internet and/or within our home LAN.,?,"Yes. The game has two modes. A Single Player mode and Multiplayer mode. Multiplayer requires an Internet connection. You will NOT be able to play multiplayer mode on LAN. The multiplayer mode requires an internet connection with an Origin account, while Simcity is updated to the latest version. In Multiplayer mode, you can create a game or even join other games. A game refers to a region where you have multiple cities. You could invite friends and your son to play in the same region. Since you want to play a multiplayer game with your son, I am assuming you would be purchasing the game once. The game purchase can only be registered with a single Origin account. A single Origin game account allows you to install the game on multiple PCs with the same account. This would technically allow your son and yourself to play the game with this account on different PC's. However, a single account can only be logged in once. Meaning, both of you cant play at the same time. So in order to play the game at the same time, you would need to purchase the game twice, have two separate Origin accounts, one for yourself and your son. This would allow multiplayer at the same time. The other mode is the single player mode. This mode does not require a persistent Internet connection to play. The game data will be stored on your PC rather than on Servers. For the single player mode, you can play the game even though your Orgin account is in offline mode. I am assuming this may allow you and your son to play a single player game without internet on two different PCs at the same time as long as the origin account is set to offline mode on both the PCs. I could be wrong though. Hope This answer helped."

What type of hard drive is needed?,,"All xbox 360s are supposed to have a hard drive . Some Units require a slim hard drive or up to a 250 that snaps in place on the top of the xbox . You need to figure out which type you need . If its the older style 360 2nd hand drives are available cheap if you look . Make sure its a OEM hard drive not a fake from china. In the mean time you can maybe hook up a large thumb drive like 32gb or 64 and could play some games till you get the right drive . I would suggest the 250 GB cause the space goes fast and is used for other things like demos , videos etc. I hope this helps. Ash"

open-ended,B00GJSUXLS,27-Jun-14,1403852400,Does this game still come with the code for unlocks when TPP comes out? Does the One version?,,"No apparently it won't for any format (one PS4 included) it won't - however; it will probably come Later as an extra included with some GOTY if the T.P.P. game goes there (?) - unless the ground Zero ""demo"" won't come at all , and it will turn into some expensive source of income for fans & collectors and speculator via e-bay and amazon sellers . The all point of it is that it was an overpriced game-play demo specifically made for the hype of T.P.P. and Kojioma (The king of the ""Hideo cames"") just showed that supporting him and his talent does not come for free. A bit like if Spielberg made us pay to see the trailer of his next movie. I conclude Video games industry even in Japan is rotten through the bones."

Mogstation won't accept my Visa, presumably because it now recognizes it's not in the same country as the billing address. I can confirm that these cards do work for people in our situations - you'll enter it into the MogStation website. I've seen FF14 cards in the convenience stores over here - make sure you don't use these, because they won't work with a NA account.

As soon as you add another character, it goes up to $ 14.99/mo., but you can have up to 8 characters. This card operates the same way.

Would I be able to use this to add days to my account?,?,"I am also in Japan, playing on a NA account, and it has been difficult trying to renew my subscription over here. Mogstation won't accept my Visa, presumably because it now recognizes it's not in the same country as the billing address. I can confirm that these cards do work for people in our situations - you'll enter it into the MogStation website. I've seen FF14 cards in the convenience stores over here - make sure you don't use these, because they won't work with a NA account. And for anyone else curious, there is surprisingly no extra lag or noticeable difference in gameplay when playing here. I've only noticed somewhat longer loading times."

As soon as you add another character, it goes up to $ 14.99/mo., but you can have up to 8 characters. This card operates the same way.

If I were to estimate, if you played it as much as the average owner, I would say you could get a guaranteed couple days out of it...I might even venture and say three days. Again thats just a guess. You might wanna poke around online and google some sites that will give you some good insight on the battery life. Hope I was able to help at least a little. Have fun and keep gaming! ;)"

There should be an option on your Playstation menu specifically for redeeming codes under the Playstation store column. It's actually a lot easier than you'd think it would be, and these expansions are entirely worth it :)"

Will these codes work with it or will it have a region conflict?,,"If your original game is a US version, then you can just make a US account on your PS and download. If your original game was Indian, then it won't work. (Source: I bought it for use with Skyrim bought in the UAE. I could download via my US account, but not play)"

yes/no,B00GS6A6V8,28-Sep-14,1411887600,are there any patches that will change the original skyrim disc game?,Y,"Yes, but how much it changes the game depends on whether you play on PC or console. All a patch does on a console is fix glitches and bugs and such with the game itself. On PC it does the same but in a way that changes the game in a few ways; for instance there is a patch that fixes the infamous dragon stalking glitch, where dragon skeletons follow you throughout the map, by erasing the dragon skeleton itself as soon as you fast travel away from it. Patches for console don't work this way. If you are on console the only way to really change the game is through DLCs and modded saves, not patches in other words. The most a patch for console will change is how merchants act and erase the ability to take advantage of various glitches. That's about it."
yes/no,B00GS6A6V8,2-Jan-15,1420185600,do the codes work on a PS3 thats not registered in the US?,?,"Short answer: yes it should work without a problem. Longer version: You are essentially purchasing the digital version of the game, which wouldn't effect its playability. As long as you can access PSN you can get the game, you just put in the code under ""redeem code/voucher"" for the ""free"" download that you purchased here and it does it at no charge. Because of this it should not have any issues as far as countries its registered to. IF YOU DO HAVE ISSUES WITH COUNTRY: all you have to do to fix this issue is make a new profile on your Ps3 that has a US address and download it through that one, doing it this way will give you the game and allow you to access if on all profiles as long as the profile is on your ps3"

I've found that mice, no matter the game, well last longer if you ease up on click pressure. It's all subjective though, I've had high end mice die in a few months and bagin bin ones last years. For the price, this mouse is great. Worst case, it doesn't work for you and you move to another."

There is a slight curve in the buttons, but does not hinder me. I am using the 1-9 buttons, my fingers are too short to reach the 10-12 unless I move my palm.

yes/no,B00GV0LR64,2-Jan-15,1420185600,will this work on a crt television. (older non flat screen tv),Y,Yes. It should just stick right on the glass. You just have to plug the USB plug into a USB port (I use one of the front ones on my Xbox 360) to power the LED. It will actually probably stick better on the glass CRT TV than on a flat screen because the glass should be a better surface for the suction cups.
yes/no,B00GV0LR64,7-Aug-14,1407394800,"So I'm guessing if the game is designed for higher accuracy WHEN aiming, this isn't going to help much.

If the suction does not cling on as easy after taking it off clean it with a wet cloth and try again it again it more then likely has dust after cleaning it will stick again ..hope this answers your question.

yes/no,B00GV0LR64,11-Aug-14,1407740400,Is there any way to use these and not cheat?,?,"Good question. Go to Youtube and search for COD Ghosts Hacks. You wont believe all the different hacks that are available and that are being used everyday. How about modded controllers ? Hundreds available thru Amazon. Nothing like shooting a bulldog shotgun with rapid fire. Seems to me that if you not cheating, then you are behind the curve. You are not playing on a level playing field anymore. I've played in a lot of matches, that if you ADS then shoot, your dead. Using the HipShotDot will help you get more kills from hipfire. Cheating, maybe, maybe not. Using the dot has helped me a little bit. I still like using the Variable Magnification Reflex sight for longer shots, but when your face to face with another player, put the red dot on him and fire. Spray and pray if you have to, kill or be killed. Remember that some of the best players having been drawing a red dot on a piece of tape and sticking it on their screen for years."

yes/no,B00GV0LR64,22-Jan-14,1390377600,will it work with ps4,?,"Absolutely. You need a USB connection to power the red led, but it doesn't matter what you connect it to in order to get that power. It works taking advantage of the basic physics of first person shooters - that the center of your screen is your aim point. It does not modify the game itself in any way."

They may include some little piece of paper but it never has any information about the game, usually just an ad for some other game or maybe an online code. If your game was used but didn't have anything in the case you aren't missing anything of importance.

open-ended,B00HGLLRV2,18-Dec-14,1418889600,looking into getting a ps4 for Christmas I played the first game and really liked it is this game on par or better then the first infamous?,,"Imo I think it's better than the first. In this one, the graphics are gorgeous and every facial animation is incredible; I found myself deeply immersed during the cut scenes. Also, the game play is phenomenal; and as you progress in the story they give you new powers; each very unique and different than the last; with each new power you get a whole new atomic bomb for it! They also give you the choice to switch between the different powers when ever you want! The only con about the game, imo, is the minor differences between the good/evil power sets; they are pretty much the same, but the different powers you get makes up for it. Overall I give this game a 9; and I recommend it to all ps4 players! Happy gaming!"

open-ended,B00HGLLRV2,12-Jul-14,1405148400,which is the best standard edition or limited edition?,,"If you're buying used, the limited edition will most likely be useless as any DLC codes will have been redeemed already. If there is no price difference, I would say get the limited edition for the heck of it. As far as the actual game goes though, there is no difference that I'm aware of."

yes/no,B00HHAIY72,9-Sep-14,1410246000,"Will it work with the game ""Elite: Dangerous""?",Y,Yes it absolutely will. Elite Dangerous has a specific setting for the x-55 stick under control settings. Also all of the buttons on the x-55 stick can be easily re-configured any way you want them. So any button can become whatever you want that button to be. Hope that makes sense.
open-ended,B00HHAIY72,25-Feb-14,1393315200,"dos it have twist action for rudder ,thank you",,"Yes it does. However, unlike the X52 series, there is no pin on the stick to prevent the twist action. I hear one has to disable this in the driver settings if one has special foot peddles for the rudder."

How many bits resolution?",,"I really can't give a specific answer for the X 55. but I have the X 52 Pro and am well pleased with the sensitivity. Also you can get a paid version of the FS4UIPC and that opens up a lot of options in FSX for all controllers. Sorry I cant be more specific, but if it is as good as the X 52 Pro, and has dual throttle functions, may be worth the price difference. Also the X 55 requires 2 free usb ports while the X 52 requires only one. The x 52 Stick connects to the throttle and the throttle connects to usb."

You'll have to pay the import taxes upfront. Those are MORE expensive than the unit... But it'll get sent straight to your house. No fuss. I just tried with my address (I'm from Rio de Janeiro), and the total was about US$ 443.00. Still... This seems to be in pre-order? 1-3 months to ship...

The PS3 model that allows PS2 back-play essentially has a PS2 inside that allows the back-ward compatibility, making that model MUCH heavier. PSone playback however is possible. Of course, PS2 games that have been brought into the PSN for digital download for the PS3 can play on here."

If you live in America call gamestop or look one up online and call and ask them and they will probably be more able to answer your questions. The reason I bought the PS3 instead of the ps4 is because you can still get online free with PS3, they are still making games for PS3 and lastly I read online the ps4 has been having a lot of issues and the PS3 have been around a lot longer and for the most part have already fixed their glitches.

Right???",,My hope is that Amazon is being cautious and giving themselves a buffer now. So that when you possibly get it on the 7th you'll be pleasantly surprised. That being said it sounds like Amazon got their shipments in late so that instead of having them day(s) before release so you get it on release day...now they are all after the date. That's what is sounded like when I talked to customer service. Very apologetic but not much they can do. I have 1 day shipping and it's the 8th for me too. I also confirmed that they did NOT oversell the preorders. That was my fear.

I bought a PDP Kinect TV Mount.
open-ended,B00HN9LS48,9-Feb-15,1423468800,I have a wall mount tv. How far back does the mount extend?,,"I would say you need about 3"" from the back side of the tv to the wall. That should do it."

open-ended,B00HN9LS48,7-Dec-14,1417939200,I want to play my kinect on my old LCD tv which is 3 inches wide. Does this fit on it?? Does it have enough width so that the back flap works?,,It should work as my son's TV is an older LCD (at least 3-4 years old) also; I never measured it exactly but he had no trouble attaching. I know for sure it's not one of those very slim edges that are on the market today. Should work fine.
yes/no,B00HN9LS48,5-Dec-14,1417766400,Does it work for Samsung curved TVs?,Y,"I'd be surprised if it did. I bought this for my flat 42"" LG and it wouldn't lock tight up top and sat flimsily on top of my television. Spend the extra few bucks for the PDP mount."
open-ended,B00HN9LS48,16-Nov-14,1416124800,Does the Kinect actually clip on and become secured to the unit or does this item just act as a wide table for it to sit on?,,Yes it snaps on to it
yes/no,B00HN9LS48,7-May-14,1399446000,Will this fit an LED screen? Credit Card thin might be a problem unless this thing really adjust to the monitor.,Y,Yes it does.

yes/no,B00HN9LS48,15-Jul-14,1405407600,Will this work on a tv that is mounted on the wall?,Y,I would say yes as long as the tv is facing at a downward angle with at least 3 inches or more space between wall and mount if that makes any sense. Hope that helps if flat it will either fit or won't. Sorry if it doesn't as my tv is not on my wall.
yes/no,B00HN9LS48,24-May-14,1400914800,Can this be used to mount the Kinect to the bottom of the TV?,Y,"I bought $1.99 Velcro 2 way tape works great, You can put it any were on the tv"

Why is that?,,"I recently bought one of these controllers and they work great. I have never owned an actual SCUF so I can't compare, but the paddles do not seem hard to press at all. The only problem I had with mine was that it was difficult to plug the microphone in to the controller because the motherboard inside was slightly off. I contacted the seller and he walked me through how to deal with the issue. It works fine now. Hope this helps."

Is there any way to get sound from this cable when it's plugged in?",?,Your T.V. probably doesn't blend the VGA with your audio input. What you need is a 3.5 audio jack to a female RCA jack. This should 100% fix your problem.
open-ended,B00HPU96FI,14-May-14,1400050800,Does the Dreamcast main menu look yellowish? I just unhooked from a CRT screen (S-video) and hooked my DC up to my HDTV w/ this cable. Looks yellow?,,"No, it doesn't look yellowish in my HDTV using this VGA cable. I would double check the color settings on your HDTV first to make sure your cabel is not defective."
open-ended,B00HPU96FI,26-Apr-15,1430031600,"So this came in the mail yesterday, and I'm not getting any picture. I have an audio splitter and I can hear some sound. Any idea why?",,"This is most likely due to the monitor not supporting the native Dreamcast resolution of 640x480. Try an alternate display device. The cable is a pass through style cable, that simply takes the signal from the dreamcast (which outputs VGA for supported games) and passes it to the VGA monitor. Some newer tv's and flat panel monitors don't properly support 640x480."
open-ended,B00HPU96FI,6-Jan-15,1420531200,"Hello, Some people say the sound is RCA only. What is that and how can I convert the sound properly?",,You get an RCA adapter that allows you to connect the red and white cable and convert them into a standard headphone output.
yes/no,B00HPU96FI,25-Feb-15,1424851200,Can you hook up the DC to your PC?,N,Not your PC but your monitor.
open-ended,B00HPU96FI,6-Feb-15,1423209600,"Just got this cable from Amazon. Fits my 42"" vizio nicely. However, the screen colors are skewed and oddly green. Anyone else experiencing this?",,"The cable didn't work on my TV. On a computer monitor it looked amazing. Only way I can see it working is with a VGA to HDMI adapter, but you have to dish out some extra bucks. The cheap ones do not work. I tried two and the colors had a yellow hue. Test the cable first on a monitor, if its clear it works. If its still bad its possible you may have a defect."
yes/no,B00HPU96FI,13-Nov-14,1415865600,I got the cable this week and when I turn on my Dreamcast the screen flickers everyone so often. Is the cable I got defective?,Y,Yes

open-ended,B00HPU96FI,7-Aug-14,1407394800,I know that light gun games do not work with HDTV's. But...becase this is connected through VGA has anyone tried to see if light gun games work?,,"As I understand it, light guns require A) a CRT, and B) a certain refresh rate that modern HDTVs (CRT or otherwise) don't support. I'm sure someone will be able to give you a more detailed answer, but I would think that the only way it might work is using an older non-HDTV CRT display. And to answer your question more directly - no, I haven't tried it. :)"
open-ended,B00HPU96FI,6-May-14,1399359600,My VGA cable doesn't show anything. I can't hear it or see it.,,"Not all Dreamcast games are VGA compatible. There are workarounds for some of those that aren't, bit you would have to search for that online. Most games will work even if not advertised though. If it is not working on any games, you may want to check your setup or see about returning it. Mine works with almost any game."

I have an Xbox One and the chat headset adapter"
yes/no,B00HS5FETM,16-Mar-15,1426489200,can you adjust the game volume and chat audio indepently from each other,?,There is no in-line volume control on this audio cable.

You need access to steam however but you dont need to be connected to the internet. simply open steam in offline mode and go from there.

Can I play the game offline once downloaded on my computer?,?,"You can play offline it just won't be connected to Steam, and a msg will pop up that says Steam won't be able to sync your game files from the cloud. That's the best answer I have from our little experiment we just did by turning off our internet and seeing if our son could still play and he could....Hope it helps!"
open-ended,B00HWMP0TU,4-Sep-14,1409814000,does this version require me to load it via a cd drive or will it allow me to just download it on steam?,,"It comes with a cd that you can load the game off of. According to the booklet you don't have to download it via the cd and can just activate it from steam, but I don't have any experience with that so I'm not sure how that would work out for you."
open-ended,B00HWMP0TU,11-Jun-14,1402470000,So it looks like there are actually 2 versions of this game. One of them is complete in box and the other requires Steam. Correct?,,"hi, how i can buy the disc ? i already bought it by download from steam and until now i can not play the game. i asked many questions and tried many ideas to solve my problem but nothing help and steam support not care at all. i just know today how to buy from amazon and send it to my city, so no more steam :)) by disc very easy and better and if have games here reguire to steam i will not buy it"
yes/no,B00HWMP0TU,30-Sep-14,1412060400,Does it work with Windows 8?,Y,Yes
open-ended,B00HWMP0TU,28-Nov-14,1417161600,so this version of the game has no physical manual or map or anything cool for my husband to be giddy over?,,"This version of the game has a Simple physical manual&#65288;7 page), a page of TECH TREE AND SPECIFIC CHARTS. It has 15 DLC. It need a account of steam. The game program can download in steam, DVD disk can't need. These help to you? if not, Please ask me in simple English again, my English is poor."
open-ended,B00HWMP0TU,1-Mar-15,1425196800,"Labeled as COMPLETE ED., but does't have EXT. PACKS &amp; DLC as box describes. What do you recommend?",,To receive all of the DLC (Brave New World and others) you'll need to activate the CD key through Steam where you will be able to download the game and all of its components. Keep in mind that you will need an account with Steam and have the Steam Client installed.
open-ended,B00HWMP0TU,2 days ago,,So if you don't want to use the disk to play you can play via steam right?,,"I am forced to keep the disk in the drive. There may be a way to play without the disk, but I'm not aware of it."
open-ended,B00I14395A,25-Sep-14,1411628400,This item as a combo is $157.99. They are separately (Mouse MX for $67.39 and K800 $64.99) $132.38. Why?,,"Have the same question. Even Best Buy has them on the store shelves for 69.99 each. And the combo should be significantly less since it probably only has 1 transceiver, and 1 extender cable."
open-ended,B00I14395A,16-Dec-14,1418716800,"This was ordered for me and came with two cables. One works with the keyboard, but the other one? I need to recharge my mouse, what do I need?",,"Yes, there are two cables. one is a Unifying receiver extender in case your keyboard and mouse are our of range or your signal is bad because of interference, it is a USB male to female. The other cable is the one you want it is a USB male to Micro male charging cable. To charge the mouse you insert the cable on a SLIGHT angle, it does not go straight in. When you are looking at the mouse the charging cable will be slightly up. Once you do it the first time you will get a feel for it."
open-ended,B00I14395A,14-Oct-14,1413270000,Is this keyboard/mouse bluetooth and how is the range on it?Will it work with my dell xps desktop in my equipment closet and i am using it in my theater room?Can it still work if my desktop is in another room?,,"I just went to my neighbors to type this sentence, 3 walls and 30 feet away,worked fine. It started breaking up at 4 walls and 40 feet away. It is not bluetoothe. It is the standard 2.4 ghz. and works 10 times better than any bluetoothe. I have had absolutely no problems with the unifying adapter. I have accumulated 2 marathon mice, and this keyboard mouse set. The unifying reciever's all work great and brain dead easy to pair up. Love the quite keyboard and smooth feeling keys. I am spoiled with this set. I'm sure it will work with your dell or any computer."
yes/no,B00I14395A,16-Sep-14,1410850800,"Does this keyboard and mouse only work when your using both? I'd like to use combo at home office, but just use Mouse when going to Corporate offi",?,"Yes, but you will need a logitech unifying receiver (available for under 10 bucks). Logitech is competing with Bluetooth and making there own receivers going away from the universal Bluetooth. On the universal receiver plus side you may have up to 6 devices synchronized. I keep two pointing devices per computer so this works for me. Logitech also claims their own receiver will eliminate the double click problem that occurs with some mice as they get older; but that remains to be seen. If you do not want to buy another receiver you make take the one from home but that defeats the convenience end so just get another receiver. Good Luck."

yes/no,B00I14395A,15-Jan-15,1421308800,"Do the rechargeable batteries 'really' only last 48-hours? (if so, then it's not 'really' wireless)",Y,"With moderate to heavy use, I get at least 5 or 6 days out of the mouse before I recharge it. The keyboard will go two weeks or more. Both would surely last much longer if I turned them off when I'm not using them; but I don't. Recharging takes about 20 minutes using the supplied usb cable."

yes/no,B00I14395A,9-Jan-15,1420790400,Can the angle of the keyboard be adjusted?,?,There are two tabs that flip down to raise the keyboard. But there's only those two angles. Normal height and with the tabs down. Hope that helps

open-ended,B00I4BGNVM,17-Jul-14,1405580400,What MMO can the game world be compared too? I like big open worlds with little zoning. Vanguard did a good job at this. Rift is 2nd I think.,,"It's similar to other MMO style games. The game is designed for players who like to explore and quest along the lines of Skyrim. Instead of kill 10 bandits or collect 10 plants objectives the game has you in the role hero wandering around saving individuals, towns, cities and kings. The game is different from other MMO's in that all skills are available. All professions, weapons, armor and skill trees with enough skill points available (a lot of work) to fill them all out on one character. PvP is similar to GW2's eternal battleground open WvWvW with the 3 factions fighting over lots of objectives. ESO's open world PvP is huge, much larger than GW2 even with all 4 zones added together. A lot more fun than GW2 to me, controlling certain scrolls gives PVE bonuses to the whole faction. Fully leveling a character through questing takes you to all 5 zones in all three factions. That's a lot of questing so I can see why players who don't like to quest or enjoy story lines would get bored with the game."

From the EU version, it seems like Campaign Pack 1 (with Shigechi and Kira) is already out, while Campaign Pack 2 will be out May 14, most likely including Fugo and Iggy.

I don't really know why that is the case. If I were to guess they may have stopped production of those models (the 250gb Last of Us and the 500gb slim).

Thank you.,,"Yes I have s gold headset and use it for both consoles. With the ps4 it is completely wireless and with the xbox one you'll need to plug the headset into the controller adaptor, so while for the xbox it's not totally wireless it still requires no connection to the console itself."
yes/no,B00IAVDOS6,20-Apr-14,1397977200,Will this work with my Astros A50s which have a 2.5mm jack?,Y,"Yes it will. I use my TB XP500 using this adapter and a 2.5mm cable which I had to buy separate. I believe your A50's already have the cable so you would be set. Enjoy the way your headset's were meant to be used, finally."
yes/no,B00IAVDOS6,3-Jul-14,1404370800,will this work on ps4?,N,No only Xbox one controllers

yes/no,B00IAVDOS6,29-Jun-14,1404025200,Considering buying V-MODA Crossfade LP and BoomPro mic. Worried that the mic will be too loud or too quiet. Can Xbox adjust the mic perfectly?,N,The only mic volume that you can adjust is the one from other people that are talking to you. I don't know if you can change how loud your mic is though.
yes/no,B00IAVDOS6,1-Jun-14,1401606000,Will this work with the SteelSeries Siberia v2s that have 2 3.5mm jacks(Output and Input)?,?,"The device itself only has 1 3.5mm jack that handles all input and output, so out of the box: No. You would only be able to connect 1 3.5mm cable. However, you may be able to find 3.5mm joiners that can combined the two cables into 1. You have to research and make sure you get an adapter with enough contacts in the right spots to ensure everything gets joined and sent through properly."
open-ended,B00IAVDOS6,7-Jan-15,1420617600,Looks like just what I need! But why does it come with a USB cable? It doesn't seem as if it would need one.,,"Some controllers, such as both of mine, require a quick process of updating your controller. It's quite simple. 1. Place adapter on controller and turn on controller. 2. Plug in headphones. You'll be prompted if firmware is needed along with the following steps. 3. Plug the Micro USB cord into the back of your xbox and to your controller. 4. Wait 5. When finished it'll ask if you would like to do another controller, go ahead do them all and be done with it. Whole process took me about 2-4 minutes and that's never have had done it before and doing 2 controllers. Quite easy and on screen prompts tell you everything you need. Big kudos to MS for making what could be a real pain in the butt into something easy and nearly idiotproof."

And how do the build quality and sound quality stack up against a mid-range turtle beach headset?,,They cup over the ear but do not match the intense sound of turtle beach. I have an inexpensive set of turtle beach (X12) and the work great with the xb one. You do have to purchase the Xbox earphone adapter though. Don't pay more than 25 bucks..shop around.

yes/no,B00ICWO0ZE,28-Jan-15,1422432000,Can you download to WiiU console? Our disc keeps freezing up.,?,I don't think you can. Your wii probably needs to be shut down or reset. When you open the cover there should be a red button just push it and it should reset the console. It shouldn't delete anything. If not then the disc needs to be cleaned.

yes/no,B00IIHU44E,24-Apr-14,1398322800,Do I need an HD tv for an Xbox One?,?,"Yes and no. Let me explain. The Xbox One only comes with an HDMI out. However, you can purchase cables/converters that will go HDMI-&gt; component or standard A/V. I can't recommend any b/c I don't have any personal experience with them but if you search on Amazon you'll find plenty. But keep in mind the Xbox One is geared toward HD content and games. If you don't use an HD TV you are not getting the full benefit of the console. It would be like buying a sports car and never driving over 40 MPH. If you are going to shell out the almost $500.00 for the Xbox One then you owe it to yourself to upgrade your TV too. HD content will become the norm. Lastly, as of now most of the games for the One are being produced for the 360, which does have standard outputs. So if you don't have a HD TV now stick with the 360 and wait till you upgrade your TV. Also, if you look there are very few One games out now. Over the next few months more will be coming out but there is a very small pool of One games. So you may be better off waiting till you upgrade your TV to buy a One anyway. Hope this helps."

The Titanfall bundle only comes with one Xbox One controller, but currently that's all you'll need since there aren't too many multiplayer Xbox One games available yet. I ordered a second controller on Amazon for the future but still haven't needed to open it. Hope this helps"

In other words, if you own a smart phone I think a kinect is the least of your worries... Nice try though."

The mouse's wheel can toggle between hyper scroll mode (where you can spin the wheel and it keeps spinning freely) and regular notched scroll mode. The button that toggles this mouse wheel functionality is specifically used for that purpose only.
yes/no,B00IRHE892,16-Apr-14,1397631600,Is this compatible with Mac?,?,"The mouse will work with Mac. I use a Mac at work and a PC at home. From my PC at home I can program the DPI settings and save them into one of the profile slots on the mouse so that they will be the same on my Mac at work. However, you will not be able to program the button functions for the mouse through the Logitech software on the Mac. Some of the buttons are programmable via the Mac preferences pane but I've found that the Mac doesn't seem to pick up the left and right scrollwheel buttons. The DPI shift button works as expected though. Also, i want to point out that the Logitech G software does have a Mac version. And I am able to program my Logitech g500 and g602 mouse with it. My guess is that the surface calibration feature of the g502 is the thing that's holding Logitech back from making this fully compatible with Mac. They've been progressively making their other G mice mac compatible over the past couple of years. So hopefully the g502 will be added to that list at some point as well."

Does 1 notch switch ONE weapon?",,"One notch switches one weapon. In ""locked"" mode, it's quite sturdy indeed and there's next to no chance of you actually scrolling the thing. In free scroll mode though, it's extremely loose and sometimes even picking up the mouse is enough to make the scroll move."
yes/no,B00IRHE892,3-Jun-14,1401778800,Can you change the color of the lights?,N,"No, the light cannot be changed. They can be turned off though."
yes/no,B00IRHE892,13-Jan-15,1421136000,Is this really a worthy successor to the G500?,Y,"Yes. I thought nothing was going to be able to replace my G500 when it stopped working. The ergonomics were literally perfect for my hand, the free scrolling wheel, braided cable and the customizable weights. My G502 literally does all of that, just better. Word of caution though, as I was used to the G500 which is noticeably bigger than the 502 (and I have relatively small hands), you won't necessarily fall in love with it immediately. After about a week or so of use and the ergonomics will start to make sense. Once that happens, it becomes better than the 500."
open-ended,B00IRHE892,18-Apr-14,1397804400,How is there 11 programmable buttons? I only see G-keys 4-9.,,"All the buttons can be reassigned, including the tilt wheel. So, 11 buttons total, all of them programmable."
yes/no,B00IRHE892,10-Dec-14,1418198400,Do you think g502 is better than Deathadder Chroma? (I'm playing BF4),?,"g502 is better in every way unless you prefer the deathadder shape or slightly lighter weight. g502 has better sensor (native at every step), build quality, software (if wanted) more buttons, features, and better customer support."

The console itself doesn't create a WiFi to hook up to. No extra devices are needed to use the WiFi feature other than having wireless internet at home or wherever the intended location may be.

If it has HDMI slots, you can connect your XBOX 360 E using an HDMI cable. If your TV does not have any HDMI slots, this bundle actually includes a 'regular, non HDMI' cable.

They definitely won't have mac support at release. I have read several forum entries that say don't try to play Wildstar on Parallels because the delay on the MAC is overwhelming. I know some people are now trying to setup Bootcamp and make it work but it doesn't sound positive. I would definitely wait till Carbine comes out with a MAC client..

Your RAM and GPU are fine, but a 2.0GHz processor is a bit slow. If you have the i7 it probably has TurboBoost. You should check out what the max speed is with the boost, if it's above 2.4 you can definitely play it.

They are incredibly different. These thumb sticks should have been originally on the PS4 controller to begin with. The original sticks were made of very crappy material and the rubber tips wear off so fast. With these sticks, you can absolutely feel the difference. They are very responsive because they are slightly taller which means they actually give you more control. No dead zone by what I can find. I played Destiny heavily for a full day with the new sticks and honestly, they are so much more comfortable. Honestly, I say just buy them. They are not expensive and it's an easy swap procedure. I promise you that you will enjoy them. Its hard to describe the feel of them besides that they grip your thumb and stay in place where you want it. Them being slightly taller means you have more control. For me the biggest selling point was the material they are made of. You can just feel that it is a stronger and better quality material. For a controller costing almost $70, you would think they could put a quality rubber on the thumb stick but they didn't. Bad news for Sony. Just buy these and put them in. You will think like me and go, ""Wow! These are the best thing Microsoft ever made for Sony!"""

yes/no,B00J6DLPLK,1-Jul-14,1404198000,"For a big fan of Nier, who deeply love the narrative and characters. Would you recommend this game? (Really don't mind the gameplay)",?,"Tentatively. Don't buy it if you're deaf, though. There's reasons. Anyway, if you go into this thinking it will be either Nier or Drakengard 1 you'll be disappointed. But make no mistake that the emotion and writing you'd expect will be there. The humor is juvenile and not always funny, but it fits into the theme of the game: Contrast. For every joke there's a tear, and for every smile there's a funeral. The characters aren't as immediately memorable, but the Zero and her dragon Mikhail have an amazing chemistry that just overshadows everything else anyway. The overall story is a great take on the concepts of ""series canon"" and timeline effects. You'll first need to know that each ending has a completely separate sequence of events, unlike in Nier where each new ending path led to more context on the situation. Ultimately Draken3 feels like a medieval fantasy timeline story, like a sort of ""Steins;Gate"" but Drakengard style. The other answerer to your question is rather on point, too. Ultimately it will feel very unique but worth it. Some moments will fall flat while others will be as amazing as you'd hope and each ending is unarguably charged with an explosion of emotions and revelations. Don't go into it expecting Nier, but you can expect quality."
