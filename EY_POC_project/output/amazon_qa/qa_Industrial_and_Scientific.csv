Thanks Mike,"Rubbermaid makes a tandem dolly to hold two of these, but it's crazy expensive (at least for a private homeowner). I don't know about a cart, though. Why don't you compare the measurements to your cart, though?

If not how do you get the mop clean?,"It depends on how much dirt is being picked up, but even when I've had a mess to clean up it only takes a few rinses to get the water from the mop to run clear. So far I've found it to be a good mop- but you really must get the mophead completely wet before you can squeeze it - otherwise it's improssible to get the handle that squeezes the mophead to work. Once it's wet though, it works fine. It is slightly larger than other sponge mops I've used which makes cleanup quicker and the mophead is dense and sturdy.",
yes/no,B00002N60G,"Nov 4, 2014",1415088000.0,Is this acid/urine resistant? To be used in an animal care facility and most mops come apart shortly.,"I think this would be your best bet. You must presoak the mop head adequately before use. The first time I used the replacement I soaked the head for an hour. Hubby said we should make sure it was wet clear to the core. Since then I have never had to resoak since it is in constant use. I use castlie soap and clorox in my water. There is constantly a bucket of clean water sitting around. I do not leave the mop in the water. I clean after use and wring out well. Then I just leave it sitting next to the bucket. With 2 shelter rescues and a 5 month-old puppy mill rescue, it is in constant use. Urine on the floor is the norm around here. Nothing has affected the mop head. There are no bits and pieces of foam coming off of the head even after the daily abuse. Constantly using the clorox has not harmed it. You will feel the head soften a bit over time which has allowed me to use it on a tiled floor and still get the grout clean. I hate mopping and this is the first one that I actually like using. It has been in constant use since June and the head is still in great shape. Also, unlike other mops, the head is secured to the handle with large screws. No breaking of plastic nuts or poles causing replacement before the head is actually totally worn out. I believe that this is the perfect mop for your facility. It will definitely be getting the kind of abuse that I give it everyday.",?
open-ended,B00002N60G,"Dec 21, 2014",1419148800.0,Can I use bleach with this mop? or does it dissolve?,I have no used bleach with this mop- I would put Clorox Clean-Up on the tile area that was dirty and later mopped it up with my other sponge mop being wet at the time. Not sure about straight clorox. I generally use white cleaning vinegar to make the floor nice and clean but sometimes bad spots do need cleaing Clorox.,

You should purchase a decent one with a rotating metal wire at the end of the gun (where the nozzle of the caulk tube goes) that is used to pierce foil seals in the nozzles of most painter's (acrylic non-silicone) caulks, and will help to break through any hardened residue in an old tube of caulk if you want to use it after it has been sitting around for awhile.",

Though not immediately apparent, a close-precision fit must exist between the ""male-grommet throat"" and the setting-tool ""spreader-foot""; otherwise a sufficient ""roll-over"" to capture the ""female-grommet collar"" will not be achieved. So, a 1/4"" tool will NOT set a 3/8"" grommet. As far as using a 3/8"" tool on a 1/4"" grommet: successful application of a grommet depends upon the ""compression-plate"" surface of the setting-tool's contact with, and compression of the ""female-grommet"" collar against the fabric --just slightly before the ""spreader-foot"" begins stretching the ""male-grommet throat""... which will occur in reverse order with too large a ""spreader-foot"". So, a 3/8"" setting tool CANNOT be used with a 1/4"" grommet.

Not sure about milling aluminum but think that with sufficient material removed by drilling first, you could mill safely enough with this and a decent small drill press, working slowly. Of course if you are a klutz or an idiot around tools, all bets are off. You don't need .001 accuracy to mill the pocket in a lower receiver. I'll update after I mill one out.

I might hesitate trying to machine aluminum but polymer works quite nicely with this vice and a decent bench top drill press. Clear the bulk of the material with a series of plunge cuts to near finished depth then use light smoothing passes. No worries. I also rigged a simple bungie hold down for the spindle travel. Alignment of the slides was easily tweaked with a little filing and a honing block. Again, the precision is good enough for a decent job on a polymer lower. Very satisfied for the intended use and the price Completed the polymer lower. Very nice. No issues with the vice at all for this project after initial tweaking. Used with Delta 12"" bench top press Just installed the lower internal parts with no further work needed on the 80% lower machining. Rest of the rifle build took minutes to assemble. Fit and function of everything looks and feels really good. Will definitely do another with this vice",?

yes/no,B0002H3364,"Jul 17, 2014",1405580400.0,Will this work horizontally?,The dual chamber theory of operation does not inherently prevent it from working in a horizontal orientation. The issue will be whether or not there will be sufficient oil continuously available at the pump with it laying on its side. It may work with the pump jack handle oriented in one position but not turned in another. For that you'll need to experiment and see if it will work in the configuration you are needing. First of all make sure the jack is completely full of oil. I don't think you can over fill them. Try adding oil with it positioned in the orientation in which you plan to use it and see if it will take any. That may make all the difference. I suggest you first go down to Walmart or Harbor Frieght and play with a jack or two before you buy one if your application requires a horizontal orientation. Experiment with one oriented exactly as you need to use it. All those cheap Chinese bottle jacks are essently the same so playing with one should be as good as another. Please post the results. I'm now curious if it'll work oriented on its side. Good luck! Jeff,?

When you have an equipment opened as a radio or a computer boards, you need to lay it on this mat and the cord will connect to ground (the ground of the electrical outlet). So, every time if there is an electrical static discharge from your body, it will short it to ground instead it will discharge to the components on the circuit board an burn them.

What temperature compensation means is that the ppm reading will not vary as the temperature of the water varys. The temperature compensation is good from 1 to 50 degrees Celsius, which is 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit. You can find this out by going to HM Digital website, which is (I will put in f_ for forward slashes and blank for period): www tdsmeter comf_imgf_selectionguide jpg . BTW, if you look at the reviews on Amazon for HM Digital TDS-EZ (the non-temperature compensated one), there is a review written by John A called, ""Convenient, simple to use. Not temperature compensated"" and he shows the ppm reading variation vs. temperature for the TDS-EZ meter. It is very large more than 100% variation in ppm reading from 54 degrees to 130degrees. Generally for the extra few bucks I wouldn't buy the TDS-EZ, if you do buy the TDS-EZ it is only good for relative ppm water readings and all the water samples have to be at the same temperature for the relative reading to be valid.

The brown wire is for the fan of the ac unit, do not install to the brown wire. The hard start capacitor black wire that has extra connector at the end is connected to red line and the other black wire is connected to the yellow wire of the ac unit. The instructions that came with the hard start capacitor should show which black line with the extra connector connects to the red line and the other goes to the yellow line.",

Lexel is a very superior product for adhesion and water resistance. It's main downside is the fact that it requires careful application and keep in mind that it does not have water cleanup. I use masking tape to mask both sides of the seam I wish to caulk. I apply a bead of the caulk and then smooth it out with a popcycle stick. This makes a round caulk seam and the tape catches the extra caulk that would otherwise get on the surface you wish to keep it off. Remove the masking tape carefully within a few minutes. You can remove excess caulk from hands or tools with paint thinner. Silicone caulk is another alternative but in my experience is not as durable as Lexel. Both however, are superior to acrylic caulks that do have water cleanup characteristics. Acrylic caulks do have their uses but when adhesion and water proof qualities are paramount you cannot beat Lexel.",

The 750 is the only model that goes to 140, the 500 goes only to 135 so the 750 is the better choice if drilling tough materials is important to you. Clearance (relief) angle is the other important variable in grinding a drill point. The 750 does have adjustability but I don't recall exactly what the limits are right now, but it is adjustable. The best thing to do is go to the Drill Doctor website and look at the user manual and the drill angle guides they have there. Even if the DD can't get the exact geometry you're after it will give you a good symmetrical starting point for a final touch-up on a grinding wheel. Hope that helps.",?

open-ended,B000BL5INM,"Jun 9, 2013",1370761200.0,Which tape should I use to mount a paper towel holder on ceramic tile over kitchen sink?,"I would think the Scotch Permanent Mounting Tape would work well for this purpose. I understand that with ceramic tile, you don't want to go through the hassle of drilling holes and sinking masonry screws. The tape will stick extremely well to the ceramic tile, and it should do OK with the plastic (or whatever) that your paper towel holder is made of. But be sure everything is squeaky clean ... use alcohol or a degreasing cleaner to remove any traces of oil or other substances (even if it seems the surfaces are clean). Since you'll be tugging on the paper towels, I'd advise putting as long a strip of tape as your holder will accommodate. This will give you extra holding power. Also, with any double-sided tape, I've found that it's best to (1) press the tape firmly in place for 60 seconds or so, and (2) let the tape ""cure"" for awhile before you put stress on it. The bond seems to grow stronger with time. Thus, this waiting period gives it a chance to achieve maximum adhesion before any demands are made on it.",

I have used the outdoor 5lb for mounting for aluminum decals that I made, and applied to a Window. The 5lb tape can withstand 115 degree weather in the Arizona desert for years, and never dries out or gets brittle. I also used the 5lb tape for mounting my Google Nexus tablet mount on my golf cart as well as repairing my cell phone clip. I trust this tape with my valuables, and more. I did purchase the 20lb, but have not used it. I am saving this for a project where I have no intention of EVER removing what I have mounted.

yes/no,B000BQK5H6,"Dec 7, 2014",1417939200.0,Will this item replace G01A-530?,"I copied this from somewhere on the Amazon site. Read it yourself but it looks like it will work. It did for me on my Jotel Lilehammer stove. When you pull out your thermopile, if the metal is stamped with Q313A (ignore the next 4 numbers = production lot # or something that is not model # related) or was a generic one with a tag on the wire of White-Rodgers G01A-534, G01A-332, G01A-502, G01A-505 / Robertshaw 1950-001, 1950-532, 1950-536 / Jade PG-36 / General Controls 101934F32, then you are in luck with this product. Honeywell is very bad about having any info on their thermopiles, so I hope this review helpful. While they label most of the packages as say Q313A 1088 etc. Honeywell Q313A1188 Thermopile Generator 750 mV 35 inch leads, this product DOES have the same Q313A Thermopile piece, but with a different naming convention on the packaging only; actual piece inside says Q313A. That being said, Honeywell makes several different versions of their Q313A Thermopile Generators. The ONLY differences are the add-ons that come with the main Q313A piece or length of the spade terminal wire on the piece itself. These differences would be: Wire length PG9 adaptor (cylindrical stepped cover that slides over the thermopile) Screw in nut 7/16"" -What my grandparents Cozy heaters use. Screw in nut 1/2"" Push-In Clip (can be used instead of either size nut) Product # / Wire Length / Connection Type / Add-Ons CQ200A-1004 / 35"" / Nut or Clip & Spade Terminal / Push-In Clip, PG9 adaptor, 7/16"" Attaching Nut Q313A 1022 / 35"" / Nut & Spade Terminal / (I don't know the nut size) Q313A 1139 / 35"" / Clip & Spade Terminal / Push-In Clip Q313A 1170 / 35"" / Clip & Spade Terminal / Push-In Clip, PG9 Adaptor (393948) Q313A 1188 / 35"" / Nut or Clip & Spade Terminal / Push-In Clip, 1/2"" Attaching Nut Q313A 1055 / 47"" / Nut & Spade Terminal / 1/2"" Attaching Nut Q313A 1105 / 75"" / Nut & Spade Terminal / 1/2"" Attaching Nut Other notes: If you have an old nut, push-in clip etc., then all you need to pay attention to is the wire length. If extra length is not a concern, just buy the least expensive thermopile when searching the part numbers. At the time of this review, it is the CQ200A-1004 and it comes with the most add-ons to boot; and Prime shipping yaaahooo! P.S. other notes: If you live in the boonies, only have a mom and pop shop, and really really really (did I say really?) need a replacement the same day, then take note that the universal White-Rodgers 3101 Millivolt Generator will work as a Q313A replacement. It IS also the same item that can be purchased under the Ace brand name (ACE 44411 or G01A-534) at a local Ace Hardware Store for $30. However, I do NOT recommend the White-Rodgers/Ace product. Due to needing an immediate replacement over very cold winter months, I have used that thrice on my Grandma's heater. One lasted all winter, the next winter needed replacing twice. The metal on the end of these expanded with heat and I have to take out the whole pilot assembly portion and cut the end of the thermopile off with my dremel to remove it from the pilot assembly. This makes what would of been a 10 minute job a (insert word for a nasty female dog); at least I removed rust at the same time and learned what to do the next time it would not pull out. For the same price, buy this Honeywell one; I have not seen any thermopile metal warping in any of our heaters with the Honeywell. Oh, these generic thermopiles do come with a push-in clip, PG9 adaptor and 7/16"" nut -adaptor and nut are both brass. P.S.S.: Both the White-Rodgers/Ace and Honeywell products are made in Mexico.",?

yes/no,B000FMYDLU,"Apr 23, 2014",1398236400.0,Can this be used to apply topical flea medication?,"That's what I use them for. The chemicals in the spot on solutions will eventually remove the calibration markings. You can keep marking the barrel to keep your dosage with a permanent marker. That will extend the number of times a syringe can be used. At some point, the plunger seal will also swell or soften until it pops off the plunger stem when you try to draw in chemical. Somewhere along this timeline it's time to pitch it and start with a new syringe. At 44.1 cents each it's the cheapest way to measure and apply topical pesticide to your pet. When you research dosages online, be safe and double check to be sure you have the right animal (cat or dog) and the correct brand of spot on. We double check our dose size at the store. We look at the package for our size of dog to get the correct amount to apply each month, then we buy (at pretty much the same price per dose) the packages for the water buffalo size dogs. If you have small animals, the monthly cost per application is greatly reduced, which makes all this process worth it. Be sure to be responsible with the unused chemical. It needs to be safely isolated from contact by children and pets. You will need a solvent-chemical resistant vial or jar (meaning glass) to empty the large retail package into. Draw your correct dosage out of that with the syringe. Keep the container labeled and stored in the original box so there will be no question about what is in the vial.",?

The 30 % higher load bearing means that it is tougher than other manufactured 4 inch corrugated pipes. Meaning that if you placed weight around the pipe of other brands it may crush the pipe, but with the stronger load bearing design using the better materials that this item is made of , it makes it stronger to withstand more pressure on it before it fails from weight on it or outside pressures as it sits under ground. Usually this pipe is used to move water away from your home, mostly used for moving rain water from the rain gutter down spouts farther from your home to keep your foundation more dryer from having less water moving to it. I bought this item to move water from the down spout into the in-ground pool that is in my back yard. Summer temps and the sun light hitting the pool water evaporates the water and I have had to use municipal water , that I pay for , to fill the pool to make the pool be at a level which let the pool work as it should. And with the charge of water being one cost for buying a gallon and twice the cost or disposal filling the pool with hours of bought water really costs me money. So when it rains the natural rain fills the pool which saves me money. During the fall / winter I collapse the pipe and store it in a shed.

open-ended,B000GLRREU,"Dec 12, 2013",1386835200.0,So does this replace floss completely?,"I had the same question, and it appears that it all depends on who you ask. My dental technician says no, it does not replace flossing. Yet I have read comments from dentists online who state that not only does the Waterpik replace flossing, it is actually better because it doesn't force food down into the gums as flossing can do. That school of thought encourages people to be sure to scrape the floss away from the gums so as to lift any debris out rather than forcing it down. My own opinion is that it depends on the precise condition of the teeth. Two factors seem to me important: How much buildup needs to be removed, and how much space there is between the teeth for the Waterpik to work. If the patient religiously brushes and uses the Waterpik daily, so that each time it is only confronting one day's worth of buildup, I would expect it to work relatively well. On the other hand, if it must attack more than one day's worth of buildup, I would expect manual flossing to be more effective. In addition, I expect that the Waterpik works better when there is enough space between the teeth for the squirts of water to get through. If the teeth are so tightly together that the Waterpik jets simply bounce back, I would think that manual flossing, that actually gets down in between the teeth, would be better. In my case, due to the orthodontic hardware I am wearing, all my front teeth are moving around and spacing themselves out evenly. This creates tiny gaps between the teeth at the gum line, and the Waterpik easily squirts through those gaps. Indeed, I can also use the little Proxabrush cleaners between these teeth (these are tiny little ""go between"" brushes that help clean out debris t the gum line). The biggest factor for me is that in order to use manual floss with the braces in place, I have to get special threader floss (it has a stiff tip about three inches long) and thread this into each brace position before I can floss that one space. It's time consuming and tedious, and I don't do it every day. I do, however, use the Waterpik every evening, along with the Proxabrush, and I brush with a Braun-Oral B electric brush several times a day. It seems like this ought to be enough, but we'll find out at my next dental visit. In summary, I would say that if the teeth are straight and even and there is a clear shot for the Waterpik to work, it ought to work well. If the teeth are uneven or overlapping (as mine were before the braces) then the Waterpik may not work as well, and manual flossing would be advisable. I also think that consistent daily use of the Waterpik would be required. It probably would not hurt to raise this question with your dentist. Since most people are pretty bad about flossing, even if they brush, the reality may be that use of the Waterpik would be better than nothing, even if manual flossing would be better than that. In other words, the worst outcome would be deciding not to use the Waterpik because manual flossing is theoretically better, but then failing to do the manual flossing either. Whatever attention is given to oral hygiene has to be better than nothing.",

This ""huge unattractive setup"" is more powerful to begin with, as is the case of almost any 110 volt tool or appliance over a battery driven item. However, the force of the water can be easily adjusted from light to quite forceful as one desires from use to use. I also have found the water seal of the battery compartment on the cordless model to fail too soon. Generally, I have found the corded model to be more durably built than the cordless.

yes/no,B000GOBN24,"Apr 20, 2014",1397977200.0,Does this product require gravel in French drain applications? A similar product does not. Much easier to install and no gravel expense.,"In principle, I agree with the response posted below on 4/17/14. I would strongly advise that you use both gravel and a pipe in the gravel wrapped with a filter material. Note the picture of a French Drain at the upper right corner of the Wikipedia article at ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_drain"". The square trench filled with gravel greatly increases the surface area that leads the water away. How much this matters, depends on how much water you need to carry away in a given time-frame. It also depends on the soil. If you put the wrapped pipe in sandy, light soil that drains well - and if you don't have heavy, long rainy periods - you might be able to get away with it. In my case, I am at the bottom of a hill with clay for soil. I had standing water year round on one side of the house and in the crawl space. I opted to build 3' x 3' trench 40 feet long on the side with the standing water, lined the trench with landscaping fabric before filling it with 6 tons of washed river rock (large marble sized bits of gravel with no ""fines"" or silt in it) with the wrapped pipe in the center (much like the diagram). Now, once water oozes through the thick clay of my soil to the river rock, it runs freely to the pipe, where it runs even more freely to daylight further down the hill. Result: No more standing water outside the house, no more standing water in the crawl space. I may have over-engineered it, but I don't think so. If I did, I prefer that to under-engineering. Summing up, by putting gravel around the wrapped pipe, 2 good things happen - a lot of water will drain away just through the gravel (the maximum flow capacity is greater) and the pipe inside the gravel will not get clogged up with silt as quickly, so your system will perform longer. (I did install a clean-out joint so that I could flush out the pipe every now and then with a garden hose if it became necessary, which you could do also). I think the best answer to your question is ""It all depends."" It all depends on your soil, the maximum amount of water you want to carry away in a given amount of time, and the amount of time you want your system to last before it gets clogged. I don't know what those conditions are, but I can tell you what I would do in your situation. I would build a french drain just like the one that I built for my situation, because then I would feel fairly confident it would work right and last longer.",?

I put in two 4-inch perforated pipes side by side (a total of 160 feet of pipe) with the drain sleeve filter fabric pulled over the perforated pipe to keep it clear of sediment. The perforated pipe was put in a ditch 3 feet deep at the beginning, 3 feet wide, 4 feet deep at the end and 0ver 80 feet long (a total of 160 feet of pipe). I then ran a regular 4-inch drain pipe, no holes in it, the rest of the way, about another 60 feet till it came out of the ground as the ground slanted. As I built the French Drain, I put the perforated pipe with the drain sleeve filter fabric on top of about 6-inches of creek gravel, then set the pipe in and then filled the ditch about 2/3 full total with creek gravel. I put some garden fabric over the rock, then filled in with dirt on top of that. The French drain goes around my shop was around two sides of my shop to drain off underground water from a wet weather spring (lots of water when it rains heavy). Without the drain sleeve fabric and rock, the dirt and sediment will eventually fill the pipe and your French Drain will stop working. I have had my French drain around my shop for about 3 years now, it works great. the French drain around my house stopped working because whoever built my house and put that French drain in didn't use this drain sleeve filter fabric and no gravel.

In order for HDPE or HDPP to be a floorboard, I would estimate it would have to be at least 1/2"" thick and supported about every foot. It would be heavier than plywood. Also, when wet is is very slick. A 4X8foot chunk would be quite expensive and even more than marine plywood. I would suggest you buy marine grade plywood as it is not subject to rot like regular plywood. Marine plywood is designed to be in wet and high humidity areas, as all layers are glued with water-proof glues. Home Depot in some areas carries it at less than $100 a sheet. Some locations may even stock the 5X8 foot sheets. Chances are your boat has a transom that is made out of marine plywood. Most fiberglass boats have marine plywood built in the transom.

Also how much does 4 by 8 sheet weigh ?.,"I don't have the specifics to answer your question....but maybe this will help. In order for HDPE or HDPP to be a floorboard, I would estimate it would have to be at least 1/2"" thick and supported about every foot. It would be heavier than plywood. Also, when wet is is very slick. A 4X8foot chunk would be quite expensive and even more than marine plywood. I would suggest you buy marine grade plywood as it is not subject to rot like regular plywood. Marine plywood is designed to be in wet and high humidity areas, as all layers are glued with water-proof glues. Home Depot in some areas carries it at less than $100 a sheet. Some locations may even stock the 5X8 foot sheets. Chances are your boat has a transom that is made out of marine plywood. Most fiberglass boats have marine plywood built in the transom. My aluminum boat does. Here is a site that explains marine graded plywood. http://www.apawood.org/level_b.cfm?content=srv_help_prd_marine There is no good adhesive for HDPE that actually makes a good bond.

open-ended,B000JJM7ZS,3 days ago,,how do you wire it or where do you find wiring instructions. i'm using it for solar/battery and grid. solar/battery will be primary source. thanks,"You need to decide something first... Do you wish solar & battery power to be used whenever it is available, and switch to line power after it is depleted, or do you wish solar & battery power to be used as a line failure backup power source, only when power fails?? If using solar battery whenever solar power is available, the front set of screws in the picture connect to the A.C. line power cord to be plugged into the wall later. (call them the front screws) It's easiest if you use a white wire( or the ribbed wire in a polarized plug cord), on the right side of the pictured relay and the other side use a black wire(or the non-ribbed smooth side) for the other one. the second set of screws on the sides near the front connect to the power inverter and the relay coil screws on the sides in the middle too, each side to the same color wire. the rear screw terminals are connected to the load outlet cord or power strip that supplies your devices. Use wire heavy enough for the system you wish to power, and inverter that you connect to. For 20 amp load use #12 wires, or for 30 amp load use #10 wires. remember that a 12 volt inverter multiplies voltage, and divides the current, meaning that a 100 watt light bulb pulls about .9 amps at 120 volts a.c., but the inverter needs 9-10 amps at 12 volts d.c. to power the inverter. so a 1000 watt inverter puts out about 9 amps at 120 volts, needing about 85 to 90 amps from the batteries needing about #4 battery cables to supply the power. 3000 watt needs a #2 cable. It's best to locate batteries close to the inverter to avoid long heavy cables. If however, you wish to use solar as a power supply when A.C. line quits working, then the line power cord connects to the second set of side screws(lower contact) and the coil middle set of screws. The inverter power cord then connects to the upper set of contacts(front screws) the output to your devices is connected the same at the back set of screws to the armature moving contacts. you may also want to use a heavy continuous-duty contactor to turn off inverter, when line power is used to give inverter a rest, and save battery power. Its best to mount in a metal box, and ground all green ground wires to the box for safety. some solar systems have a Positive ground (red wire) connected to ground instead of the negative (black) wire, so if grounding the solar units separately, you may not be able to ground the inverter, and may have to reverse the black and white inverter power output cord wires to prevent grounding problems in Positive ground situations if needed. If you use a Motor home inverter, this relay will likely not be needed, and will automatically switch over internally to line power when available.",

Your chrysler has a plastic bumper skin - you cannot mount the towbar to it. You'll need a frame mounting kit to safely tow. I don't know if there is one available from Amazon - the installation is usually involved, since you cannot weld or drill legally to the frame of any vehicle. You may be able to use the bumper shock mount bolt holes with longer bolts. the mount you need will mount to both frame rails, with a crossmember that will hang just below the bumper. This crossmember is where you would mount the towbar to, with those mounting brackets included with the towbar. Many states require a braking system to the towed vehicle in a configuration like this , and all require lights on the towed vehicle. You'll need to either buy towlights ( magnetic base that will plug into your 4 flat harness on the van) or have the chrysler wired for front towing. If your chrysler is not all wheel drive or 4 wheel drive, you won't be able to tow it with the front wheels on the ground, as this will destroy your transmission.

The distance of the bolt hole centerline to centerline on my Jeep is 29 1/4 "". The brackets supplied with the towbar are "" C "" shaped, and will not work alone going over a plastic bumper assembly such as you have. The towbar MUST be securely mounted to the frame rails. In order to do this correctly, you will need to make a cross mounted bar of at least 3/8"" thickness to mount the towbar to. You'll need to make a basic ""C"" shape bar, with the short legs bolted to the end of the frame rails of the Mustang, thereby giving you the space to drill the 5/8"" holes for the towbar mount brackets. Legally you cannot weld to the Frame rails, so bolting is recommended - besides, you'll be able to remove it after your move. The geometry of the cross mounting bar MUST be exact - otherwise you'll risk losing the car or trashing the tires as you go. Also - the towbar only comes with 1 set of chains usually, and you need to have the towbar chained to the tow vehicle as well as the towing vehicle. It can get complicated and there is little room for error. As a side note, you need to check the tightness of ALL bolts concerning and connecting the towbar and vehicles as they almost always loosened on the road. After the initial tighening and adjustment, dab fingernail polish on the threads at the Nut to help lock them together. Best of Luck!!",

The battery helps to create the ionic charge (Sakuma et al., 1987). In the middle of the plastic handle there is a metal conductor rod. It connects the bristle portion to the battery. A second conductor (the metal strip) is also connected to the battery. When you grasp the handle of the toothbrush, and hence the metal strip, an electric circuit is formed through your body, your teeth, and the conductive rod. The resulting ionic action weakens the electrostatic bonds that enable tartar to stick to your teeth.

With optional rubber sleeves, you don't need to mess with PVC cement. Note, however, that standard 1.5"" rubber sleeves will fit your 1.5"" PVC pipe but NOT fit your 1.5"" Campbell check valve (they're a little too small on the Campbell coupling end).

The first consideration is adherence. The glue on the tape is very strong and it seems to hold well over time on smooth surfaces. I think you would be able to get the tape to stick to a smooth and curved surface like a shower hand grip if it's smooth. If the surface of the grip is bumpy at all, it probably won't work. The second consideration is moisture. I don't have any first-hand knowledge of this because my tape is not exposed to water. There is another review where the person stated they used it on the stairs of their outdoor wooden playset. It sounds like the tape had some peeling at the corners after a summer of use. From that, my guess would be that the tape might work for your purpose but you might need to replace it occasionally if it is in contact with water/steam.",?

Even after use it I whip off the white tip that the sell person told me to do. Times I had suck on the soap part to get it to work. Then I gave up and add soap to the main water. When I had a water pumps go bad is you get water on the floor and you are stuck. Because it will not suck it up. So it might be plugged tubes. I had nothing but trouble with one. I could not get one floor done. I had two years left on it. I got rid of it. It was the worse shampooer I ever had! Most trouble I had with this one is beaters stop working on me. Or the wheel would melt or bend for the beaters would stop. Best wishes on it and I hope it helped you out. Linda C,?

You allow it to dry on the surface you applied it to, and do not rinse it off. Benefect is not designed to be a cleaner, just a great disinfectant. House hold traditions dot com has all the data. Personally I would use on granite, wood & stone by spraying a layer on after cleaning or dusting the surface. I do not have any experience cleaning granite, but have never had any issues with Benefect leaving an unwanted residue or stain issue. I use a steam mop on my laminate wood floors and if I wanted to use Benefect on my floors, I would either spray them after cleaning or apply full strength and go over the floor with a Benefect soaked rag or mop. It depends how much disinfecting is needed I guess. When we used it in the office to disinfect special water submersed tools, we would soak the tools in a diluted solution (water & Benefect), thoroughly rinse the tool as the water had crud in it from soaking, and then spray on the Benefect and let dry.

Washing your laundrey in this product in hot water would be a plus. Just a suggestion try apple cider vinger in a bucket of hot water on the floors. Do a small spot to make sure its not going to do any discoloring. This is after spraying with Alcohol and letting it sit. Make sure you vaccum and than continue the floor washing with apple cider vinger and water. I hope this helps.

Magnets, especially strong ones, tend to go from no noticeable force to smashing together with more force than a sledge-hammer swing faster than you can react. Get a couple with a pull force under 15 lbs. and use those to discover how brutal rare-earth magnet accidents can be in the small-scale before you even consider buying something this size that is potentially lethal.

I can remove the magnet on the door (to isolate it from other metal) , but cannot remove the one set in the frame.","I have my doubts. Remagnetization could happen at ambient temperatures, but to be efficient with an all-metal magnet, heat is required. If hot magnetic metal cools under the influence of a strong magnetic field, it retains some of the magnetic field strength. There are two problems in your situation, 1) heating a *plastic* magnet, and 2) heat transfer to the neodymium magnet, which is not only heat sensitive, but highly brittle. But I'd be willing to try. First, passive magnetization. Then, if that doesn't work, heat from a hair blow dryer, wearing safety glasses. The idea is to soften or slightly melt the plastic so the embedded magnetic particles can re-align, and the plastic cool and reset around the tiny magnets. I'd also try holding the neodymium magnet to the aluminum frame of the shower door, to see if enough magnetic force could be generated to keep the door closed, and if so, glue it in place with epoxy or silicone. Or if the force is too strong to actually open the door easily, buy a smaller, more low-profile magnet for the permanent set-up. Or install two neodymium disk (coin-shaped) magnets, one on the outside and one on the inside so that no re-magnetization is needed. The aluminum frame will attenuate a magnetic field, but the plastic or glass of the door will not.",N

Thanks!","Although I don't pretend to be an expert on electricity and magnetism, I have had some experience with these (and other) neodymium magnets. In general, I can tell you that I've never seen a noticeable (or measurable) degradation of the magnetic field strength simply due to the relative positioning of the poles. However, the caveat is that I only keep the magnets in a given position for a relatively short time (hours- not days or weeks). I would think it very likely that variables like the distance between the magnets and the amount of time spent in very close proximity could cause the natural gradual weakening of magnets to be accelerated somewhat. I'm not sure I understand how you're proposing to use the magnetic fields to create a ""friction-less vertical axis"", however. If you're attempting to create a magnetic buffer zone (or cushion) between the ""like"" poles of the magnets (much the way ""bullet"" trains glide (with very little friction) over their tracks on an electromagnetic cushion) then you might consider the following: Magnets attract or repel certain metals because the normal distribution of charged particles within them changes from a random (electrically neutral) state to a polarized state in which negative particles congregate at one pole and positive charges (or the absence of negative charges) move to the other (all magnets are dipoles). Btw...the terms ""north pole"" and ""south pole"" are arbitrary....the only relevant point is that they're either the same or different poles (magnetic lines of force emanate from the positive (i.e. North) pole and re-enter through the negative (i.e. South) pole).

A Mid-West Catalog No. 68405-00 DP Gage works great. But, first you need to understand what the pressure is on the inlet and outlet sides of your 20-BB filter. You will get 4 to 5 psi differential with a new filter; DP increases as your filter degrades over time. Install a tee with a 1"" X 14 FNPT reducer at the inlet and outlet. Install an inexpensive 0-100 psig gage in each. Starting with a new filter, record the DP weekly, preferably on the same day. When you notice a difference in the water flow during evening water consumption, you've got the DP value you need to select a Mid-West DP gage. The DP at the time you ""notice"" the flow degradation, is the RED Transition Point (PSID). Select the DP Gage based on your Transition PSID value, remove the 0 - 100 PSIG gages, and install the appropriate DP gage. Hang on to your ) - 10 PSIG gages in case you decide to use a different style filter. Each filter type will degrade differently. Hence, different DP characteristics. It takes a little research and 1 filter cycle, then you can simply let the RED Zone do the reading for you. Cole Parmer sells the Mid-Western model DP gage you need. There is a table to choose from.

They still will be safe at pressures less than 90 psi. However unless you plan to use a finer filter cartridge for the secondary filter, the primary filter will do all the work and the secondary filter will be of very little value. As a practical example a primary filter rated at 50 microns and a secondary at 10 microns would make sense. That way the primary would catch matter above 50 microns and the secondary would catch matter between 50 and 10 microns. Particles smaller than 10 microns would pass through the array.

Anyway it has a lot of suction for its size, make sure you have the deflector in place to avoid damage to the filter or bag. Due to design constraints for portability the inlet is close to, and aimed directly at the filter. I find the cartridge filters clog much faster than bags resulting in loss of suction, especially with fine particulate like drywall dust, I believe this is true with any shop vac. The 5.5 horse model is rated at 195 cfm , most individuals would not notice a difference. For low cost portability and power these are good choices but consider using a bag if you find your cartridge filter is clogging too fast resulting in loss of adequate suction for the materials you are sucking.

It needs to be tied directly into the frame of the vehicle. You might be able to find a bracket or plate that ""grabs"" both front frame rails. Rough Country comes to mind. Or maybe you could have a front receiver mounted and pull from that. I have one for the rear of one of my rigs. Allows me to move the winch from front to back. Nice! Hope this helps. Good wheeling!",

Well, I just tried it. In the process of trying to separate the first one from a stack of six, the a piece of the magnet sheered off. And my 50 y.o. hands (mildly arthritic from lupus, but just mildly) struggled greatly. But I did eventually get two separate magnets and put 1) thick paper 2) CD Rom between them. Paper wasn't sufficient. CD Rom was thick enough to allow me to separate them without hurting my hands in terms of muscles/joints but (!) in doing so, the magnets snapped together as I was pulling them off (they were a good three inches apart, one in each hand) and they pinched my finger. These are just so strong that trying to work with them is really a pain if you are trying to deal with only two or three at a time. I'll play with them a little and see if I can come up with a way to separate them safely.

If they come in direct contact with each other they are tough to pull apart (in twos and threes). If the curtain already has a hem you can probably just make a snip and put a magnet in then seal up each side so the magnet doesn't move around. If it doesn't then it depends on the material. If it can be hemmed, you're good to go. Otherwise, not sure how you would attach them such that they wouldn't end up sticking together and being a pain. May be a job for lesser magnets, actually.

Methocel is the only ingredient I don't recognize. It's made by Dow.

If you search for 'Periactil Precondition White Paper' you will find an evaluation online showing, by using PeriACTIL, a 59.0% reduction in plaque index, 94.6% reduction in 6 mm perio pouches and a 58.41% improvement in the gingival index. The study was via PeriACTIL alone. Even better results could be anticipated by using the Preconditioner as well. Again, however, we do not have data comparing this to Periogen. We could not locate a white paper on Periogen. The PeriACTIL Precondition Kit does not contain fluoride, a controversial chemical. PeriACTIL contains xylitol, which Periogen does not. If you decide to use both, we recommend you use them at totally separate times and use PeriACTIL at least at bedtime for protection throughout the night.

open-ended,B002G7EIB2,"Dec 18, 2014",1418889600.0,"What is the difference between the Floor ""Refresher"" and the Floor ""Polish""? I have old refinished hardwood floors. Thanks!","I called the company to find out all the answers about these products because I read so many conflicting reviews about the refresher and the polish. Many people didn't really understand the difference between them or how to use them. This is what I found out: (1)The refresher is the product that was right for us. We have wood floors that had a polyurethane finish on them, and they hadn't been refinished for about 6 years. They were looking so dull, and I felt they were becoming damaged from the water and dirt being tracked in, but with the holidays upon us, I didn't want us to take on the more time consuming project of refinishing with polyurethane. I wanted something that could be done quickly and easily and would look nice and keep the floors from getting more damaged. The refresher is the product made specifically for floors that already have a polyurethane finish on them. The refresher is a polyurethane product itself and so it combines chemically with your finish and will NOT have to be stripped off when you go to refinish your floors. When you use the refresher, it will add a beautiful luster and it will only take minutes to apply and minutes to dry. (2) Not so with the polish. It is NOT meant for floors that you intend to eventually refinish with polyurethane. It is just as easy to use, it looks just as nice, and it will cover over your polyurethaned floors just fine, but once you use it, you CANNOT use the refresher over it (a polyurethane product) and you CANNOT refinish your floors with polyurethane after using the polish, without first stripping off the polish. Before I understood the difference I went ahead an used the polish on one section of my floors, my hallway. After that, I found out that I should have used the refresher since we intend to refinish our floors with polyurethane. But from this point on, I will have to always use the polish on my hallway and the refresher everywhere else, unless I want to go through the trouble of stripping off the polish and using the other product only. Since the polish did a great job putting a shine on the floors, I will just continue to use it on that one spot. (3) I specifically asked the company which is the more durable product, and they stated unequivocally that the refresher is the longer-lasting, more durable finish.",

This may stem from a problem with the product clouding if not applied correctly. That is how I ended up ordering it through Amazon. I use it in the same manner. Word of warning. If you do choose to apply a second coat, wait longer between coats. That was my downfall. Even though the label clearly states 2 hours, don't do it. Wait 4 at least.

They do make a ""Snap-in"" vs a surface mount. The side mounts that I used use screws to mount to the side of the drawer and the keeper screws into the frame of the cabinet. I used the 10 lb size and they work excellently on heavy drawers in my motorhome used to house cartons of soda and other canned goods so the drawers don't slide open while traveling. Yet, they are easy to open when you want to. The ""snap-in"" version would require a hole to be cut into the drawer at exactly the proper place so the latch could be snapped into the hole. There would be a possible issue with the body of the snap-in intruding into the drawer storage space where it could get broken or reduce storage space slightly.

WARNING: Keep these products away from your pets, especially DOGS. Keep all products with Xylitol away from your dog. According to the FDA, Xylitol can be deadly to a dog. ""Xylitol is approved for human use and considered a safe sugar alternative for people. It is commonly used in sugar-free products such as candy, chewing gum, and baked goods and often a component to oral hygiene products like mouthwash and toothpaste. Xylitol can also be found in over-the-counter-medications, vitamins, and throat lozenges. Xylitol is also available in bulk for at home baking. Xylitol, a sugar compound sourced from the Birch tree, has been recently discovered to be 100 PERCENT LETHAL TO DOGS. In dogs, Xylitol causes a rapid release of insulin, causing a sharp decrease in blood sugar. It also can alter the electrolytes, potassium and phosphorus. Dogs can become depressed, uncoordinated, and weak. In severe cases, liver failure and coagulopathy (difficulty in blood clotting) can occur. Large amounts of Xylitol can cause seizures, coma, and even death. Symptoms can occur within minutes to days of ingestion of even a small amount (half of a stick of gum). If you think your pet has ingested any product containing Xylitol, contact your veterinarian or the Animal Poison Control Center immediately.""

Then use a lead insert in the hole to give your screw some threads. Personally, I wouldn't drill in cement because if water gets in and freezes it expands and breaks the cement up over a few seasons. I would simply mount the entire Kick Away centered on a piece of plywood 14 by 22 inches. I used half inch plywood. Then I cut two strips of wood 3/4 inch or thicker that are 22 inches long. I mounted both strips on the bottom of the plywood along the edges of the larger 22 inch plywood to keep the unit off the cement. I then put 4 rubber feet, one on each corner to keep the Kick Away from moving during use and to keep the wood drier off the cement to avoid rot. The large plywood is cut larger than the Kick Away so you can stand ONE foot on the plywood and clean the other foot. Then switch feet. Use mine every morning following our 2 mile walk. Still outside on our cement driveway in front of one of the parked cars and the garage door. Kick Away is holding up just fine.

Now with the extra, unfused, tape. Pull tight and wrap around the exposed wire until completely covered.

Be aware that the wrapping process can be difficult in tight places because the silicone wants to grab nearby stuff. If you can take the handle off to wrap it that would be ideal.,

Second, don't turn the stirrer up too high-- start out slowly and gradually increase the rotation speed. Once you reach a speed at which you can see the water moving, keep it there. As more water gets moving, the stirring effect will accelerate. If the magnet starts jumping around in the jar, you've gone too fast. If it clinks against the sides, you're not centered. So, the main points I would stress are: 1. Center the magnet and the jar. 2. Don't go too fast.",?

I thoroughly read it and I didn't see anything that said that measuring glass temperature wasn't possible. Here is the paragraph in the instructions that tells how to take temperature measurements: 1. When taking measurement, point thermometer toward the object to be measured and hold the yellow trigger. The object under test should be larger than the spot size. 2. As the distance from the object increases, the spot size of the measuring area becomes larger. 3. Make sure the target is larger than the unit's spot size. The smaller the target the closer measuring distance. When accuracy is critical, make sure the target is at least twice as large as the spot size. There is a lot of other information on the instruction sheet; but there is nothing saying that glass can't be measured. I hope this info will help you. Otherwise I don't have any other answers.

I use mine to load dead mowers and ATVs onto a trailer. I would say under a light load where the winch is not struggling, several minutes (2-3) is all I would do. Feel the case, if its too hot to keep your hand on, stop and let it cool. Under a heavy load where the winch is near stall, I readjust the pull or two-part the line. I never pull near stall more than a few seconds at a time. So far my winch has been working great following these guide lines.

I have never used a 25cc gas blower. The blower on the 6.5 hp vac does seem to do a good job, very adequate for blowing leaves or other household needs. I have not run into anything yet that this vac can't handle. My only complaint since I bought the 6.5 hp vac is that you can't carry it and use it due to the bulky size and the canister clips not being designed for this as well as the accessory storage panel could be a little better. These are minor things due to the extra long hoses and the fact that the storage is optional to use and adequate enough for the most part. I would definitely purchase this again, without hesitation.

I can tell you this, I have used the 6.5 HP shop vac to clean outside my basement windows (twigs, spider webs, leaves) as well as to clean my wood burning pellet stove (very fine wood ash) and it has done a wonderful job. It comes with plenty of attachments and a very large diameter hose that can easily handle most normal leaves. The suction power is also very good. I can't say that it will handle what you want it to, but I think that if you have at least 2 1/2 to 3 inches of access between the boulders that with the hose and attachments it should be able to get the job done. The vac also comes with a curved attachment so you may be able to gain access from above using that. My only concern would be what kind of nest and how big the ""twigs"" and ""wood"" are. A normal birds nest should not be an issue, even if you have to break it up a little with the attachments or a stick before using the vac. I hope this helps.",?

Bottom line: I would ask the seller before buying to make sure which one you are getting.

For the I2C sainsmart, search on sainsmart 2004 or 20x4 or on the but the pinouts can differ so you must ID the source. Here is a typical example display, with pinouts http://www.hwkitchen.com/products/lcd-display-4x20-characters/ or this tutorial: http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/LCD-Blue-I2C The Sainsmart board includes a 4 pin header and a two pin header on a separate I2C board on the backside of the display, looks like this http://4tronix.co.uk/arduino/I2C_LCD_Module.php. The two pin connection must be jumpered to provide backlighting. The 4 pin connector has two pins for 5V power coming from the Arduino, and two data transmission pins. Hope that helps.

Thank you.","The size of the bandage really only depends on the wound. I've never planned to have any certain size or kind of injury, but it would be safer to have both, just in case. The six inch can be a little bit too big for the average medical kit when added to the assortment of other bandages, ointments, adhesive tapes, splints, painkillers and so on, but even more so if you have more than one of these bandages. The good news is, that regardless of size, they are sterilized and vacuum sealed to take up the least amount of space possible. I personally like the 4"" more just for the simple fact it is easier to work with regarding pad and strap manipulation when applying the bandage. Also, if you ever have an instance where this dressing needs to be used as a tourniquet, the shorter width pad gives you precious seconds more to tighten down not only the pressure because your working with less surface area, but also with the length of the straps. The 6"" pad takes longer to work as a pressure dressing or tourniquet and the straps are very, very long. The straps on the 4"" are already long enough for any injury that they might be used for. And remember, If the vacuum seal is broken and you can squish the bag in your hands easily or even hear crinkling noises when handled, the item should be returned and you should get your money back, because the seal has been compromised and the package is no longer sterile, therefore it should never be used unless for tourniquet purposes only and there are no other sterile means of helping the injured individual right away.",

Has anyone else experienced this?,"Susan, While I have not experienced this myself, I have learned that cords will get hot when the appliance you are plugging in are not receiving the amount of voltage necessary. This could be from the circuit where you normally plug your sweeper in, or from the sweeper itself. If the cord is becoming hot no matter where you plug it in, depending on how old it is and if its still under warranty, I would take it to a Hoover certified repair shop. They can make sure its not the motor or a simple replacement of a resister, capacitor, etc. Especially if it gets hot no matter where in the house you plug it in and this doesn't occur with other appliances. If everything check out, then I would have an electrician check your fuse or circuit breaker box and make sure the line has not deteriorated and needs more wattage. The line should be pushing a minimum of 120V. If it's not, you may also have too many appliances relying on that one circuit. Normally, this would throw a breaker, however, I'm not an electrician but these are the steps I would take to solve the problem. Good luck!",?

open-ended,B003ES5TL0,"Mar 18, 2014",1395126000.0,why are there no instructions to assemble this product???,"Before I purchased the Olympia cart I scanned several customer reviews and the majority mentioned the inclusion of no instructions. The response to the problem was, from most, to spend some time looking at all the parts and mentally figure out how the cart should go together, keeping very close tabs on the nuts and bolts during the assembly process because there are no extras provided. I followed this advice and was able to construct the cart with no difficulty. I have a couple of suggestions that might help. First, attach the four support columns to the bottom tray but save attaching the wheels for the LAST segment of the assembly process. (The wheel assemblies use the large bolts and nuts so you'll want to set those aside.) Second, all the smaller bolts, nuts and washers go to assembling the frame (trays and supports). I found it very important to leave the bolts and nuts fairly loose during initial assembly because once the bottom and top trays are attached via the support columns, you'll need to spend time aligning the two so that they are square. This requires that you wait to tighten down the bolts until you go through the alignment process. I found this to be time consuming but necessary. Finally, once the frame is constructed and firmly squared up, attach the wheels. The lack of instructions is a hindrance but you can pretty much figure out how the pieces fit just by carefully eyeballing the parts. It is a very good cart for the money and I'm quite happy with it. I use the cart in my pottery studio to transport pots from inside out to the gas kiln for firing.",

open-ended,B003PDB79W,"Apr 3, 2014",1396508400.0,is this a test to determine whether or not the body is acidic or alkaline?,"Yes, these are strips that helps show your ph balance is acidic or alkaline. The healthy range needs to be in the 7.0-7.05. You can use saliva or urine on these. Urine is the most accurate but test the urine in the morning on the second time around because the first time you go to the bathroom the urine is too acidic to test the reason is because the urine sits in the body to long during the night. If you decide to test the urine just use a jar it makes the testing easier. There are several places to get alkaline supplements at Health Food Stores or on line. You can try this also but the taste is something to get use too but it works and is cheap is to take 1 teaspoon of baking soda per 1 teaspoon of black strap molasses this will help bring up the ph balance and if you need to double the recipe you can or take the drink couple times a day until you are where you want to be at. If you decide to go the baking soda route you need to put 1 cup of water on a stove until a little warm and then put the baking soda in and stir until the water is clear. Take the water off the stove stir in the molasses. Taste better when the drink is warm and comfortable to drink. You need to test your ph everyday because one day you maybe alkaline and the next day you could be acidic by eating something acid that can effect you ph and lower your ph in the 6s. Nothing can survive in an alkaline body that ranges in the 7.0 - 8.0 range. How to eat an alkaline diet you can get books or info on line if you have not done so already that tells you what foods are acidic or alkaline and how to figure what to eat with what to make sure you eat an alkaline meal. You can eat acidic food but you need to eat something alkaline with it to off set the acid to bring up the blood to alkaline level. It's not hard to do once you get the hang of it.",

Why isn't 1 sufficient?,"The outer or end pad tests the ph by testing the concentration of hydrogen ions present, hydrogen ions have a positive charge (H+) and are acidic. The other pad I believe tests the presence of hydroxl ions, they are negative (OH-) and are alkaline. It seems the strips are testing the positive (outer pad) and the negative (inner pad) to get a more accurate results. One pad (outer) tests the H+ while the other tests the OH-. The more H+ the lower the ph and the more OH- the higher the ph. So each pad approaches the test from opposite ends of the scale making them complimentary. One pad sensative to the + ions present and the other sensative to the - ions. The outer pad should be sufficient and the inner one just as a back-up. To really simplify, the outer pad begins at 0 through 14 (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14) and the inner pad begins at 14 through 0 (14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0). In the ideal, the outer pad (H+) and the inner pad (OH-) should reflect the corrosponding colors to a certain ph but in the real world they may be off a little. When (H+) and the (OH-) are balanced the ph is 7. The reason we are told to use the outer pad is because testing ph by measuring the hydrogen ions is the most common method but either pad should give the same result.",

I strongly prefer the cotter pin and I suggest you file a flat spot in the location necessary before drilling.

The ribs in the tank shrink more during the molding process, so the area where the round rubber seal hits the tank isn't flat, hence the leak.

Will these support a seated man swiveling?,"I returned the item shortly after trying to do the same thing as you. It worked, but not very well. It did swivel, but the motion wasn't smooth like you'd prefer it to be. I don't believe it was a weight issue (I'm 5'9"" 185 lbs), but rather a design issue. By design, the lazy Susan rotates on a perimeter ball bearing track...whereas a proper chair swivel ""swivels"" from a single point in the center. I found a number of web retailers that carried recliner chair swivels. Turns out, most chairs have a standard base design, so it was quite easy to swap out the feet on my chair with a swivel that fit perfectly. Now, instead of rotating on a track, the chair spins on an axis.",?
open-ended,B0045DWGSW,4 days ago,,Can holes be drilled in the outer ring? It appears these bearings only have mounting holes in the inner ring? I presume the 650 pound spec is for a compression load. Can the bearings also be loaded in tension? I am looking for a light weight bearing to...,"This bearing has no off set. Its machined out of a single pc, and relies on the little plastic feet for offset between the two sides. I pulled all the little feet out, continued drilling the holes through, and used spacers/washers to create the gaps needed for movement, and clearance for nuts n bolts etc... It seems to carry load pretty well. my application is on a printing press that hold a large carousel about 100 lbs, and a continuous added pressure of 20 - 30 lbs. I wouldn't be able to comment on what force it would handle in a shearing, or lifting situation. All in all if you're handy you should be able to make it work, and the only negetive I would have ( other than the flat/ no offset ) would be that because it's cut from one pc, theres actually some spots that it wants to bind up in rotation due to the cut not being perfectly round. Under load tho this doesnt have a huge impact on function. Hope this is helpful at all. Good luck",

(Spun at only 12RPM tho) All but one worked great. Due to their larger size and smaller overall material, they did ""adapt"" to shipping influences and egged-out. (A quick few strategic bounces on a concrete floor got them back into the ballpark where minor bench manipulation completed the re-rounding of them. Other item to note (at least for us it was), the ball bearings were greased with a thick grease that actually attracted and held small particles and waste. Minor objects got lodged in the system, stopping many of the turntables. A quick wash-out of the grease (and replacement with a thinner lube) made everything happy. They can easily do a couple hundred pounds more than I put them thru. Hope this helps.",

But, this scope is tiny, has only four buttons, doesn't have a backlit screen and is only a single channel. Using the four buttons to navigate through the menus takes a bit of time and patience to get used to. But, once the buttons and menus are understood, the scope proves itself to be capable for viewing waveforms and voltages. And, it doesn't cost very much. So, if you're really budget constrained & the specs match what you need, it's hard to beat the HPS140I. In comparison, I also own a Velleman HPS50 which is more than double the cost of the HPS140S.

The process that this device uses to control speed is actually turning the motors on and off at a rapid speed as determined by the settings of the controls. One setting is for pulse width, the time the motor is turned on. The second setting is for the frequency that the motor is switched on and off. Generally you set the pulse width and forget it and use the frequency to control the speed of the motor. It will work with even a light bulb by turning it on an off which will limit the amount of lumens available in a space. You'd go nuts with the flickering.",Y

Thus yes you could cut it open then retrive capsule to activate it. Not advisable though it looks cool. here is why Glow sticks give off light when two chemicals are mixed. The sticks consist of a tiny, brittle container within a flexible outside container. Each container holds a different solution. When the outer container is flexed, the inner container breaks, allowing the solutions to combine, causing the necessary chemical reaction. After breaking, the tube is shaken to thoroughly mix the two components. In glow sticks, phenol is produced as a byproduct. It is advisable to keep the mixture away from skin and to prevent accidental ingestion if the glow stick case splits or breaks. If spilled on skin, the chemicals could cause slight skin irritation, swelling, or, in extreme circumstances, vomiting and nausea. Some of the chemicals used in older glow sticks were thought to be potential carcinogens.[10] The sensitizers used are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, a class of compounds known for their carcinogenicity. The glow stick contains two chemicals and a suitable dye (sensitizer, or fluorophor). The chemicals inside the plastic tube are a mixture of the dye and diphenyl oxalate. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two molecules of phenol and one molecule of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon-the color of the emitted light-depends on the structure of the dye. The reason the reaction is so slow and releases only light, not heat, is that the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition (it violates Woodward-Hoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.",?

There are laws that require all medical items to have an expiration date, so it is likely shortened for safety/liability sake since it could potentially be a life-threatening incident when it is used.

So let me try to give you an answer by way of analogy: Have you ever seen those rolls of brown paper in restrooms in stores? These paper towels are much softer than those. However, these are not anywhere near as soft as the new paper towels marketed by Kleenex (the ones they recommend you use in place of hand towels in the bathroom). We use these mostly in the kitchen, but I do use them to blow my nose and they are soft enough, and strong enough, for that (I go right through tissues!).

open-ended,B0050NZ57A,"Sep 7, 2013",1378537200.0,hdd record some times,"I'm not sure the question but I'll answer what I know. You can replace the HDD in the DVR if you wish maybe for a larger HDD or for backups. You can program it to record all or specific channels all the time. You can program any or all of the channels to record during certain times of the day or days of the week. You can even program it to record some or all channels only when motion is activated. You can have that motion activation set for different times of the day and different areas of the camera's view can be set for the activation, so as to not record unwanted movement; for example, you can program an outside camera pointed at your driveway to ignore the traffic on the road but start recording once movement is in the driveway. Moreover, any of the before mentioned modes can be intermingled by each camera when you program it yourself at home. As a side note, you can back up the HDD files online or via a computer on the network but it is slower than I would like. For example, if I got an email that someone was in my home, I would wish it could record online at the same time for me but this is not exactly an option. You kind of can but it causes other record issues so it is best to hide the DVR so the intruder cannot find it.

Rather, USP is the acronym for United States Pharmacopeia, the body responsible for setting the standards. So if you look at the label, you will see USP Kosher Food Grade. This indicates that this product meets the USP standard for food grade propylene glycol.",

open-ended,B005F5OJG6,"Jun 26, 2014",1403766000.0,What is the purity of this product?,"These carriers are made in four grades: Pharmaceutical Grade - for human consumption including by inhalation Food Grade - for human consumption by ingestion but not inhalation Agricultural (Farm) Grade - for use in connection with animals Industrial Grade - for use in machinery, manufacturing and similar purposes All of these grades except Pharma Grade contain contaminants, in increasing amounts as the grade quality reduces. This is the difference in the grades. DO NOT BUY FARM GRADE OR INDUSTRIAL GRADE MATERIALS FOR INHALATION - THEY ARE CONTAMINATED. Even Food Grade should probably not be inhaled, because the digestive system can handle the contaminants in it that the lungs may not be able to. An example of this kind of difference is the flavoring chemical diacetyl, which has a very strong butter popcorn aroma. It is safe for ingestion (eating) as the digestive system can neutralize it; but it can be fatal when inhaled over a period of time as it causes a degenerative lung disease called 'popcorn lung', Bronchiolitis Obliterans. This is a rather extreme analogy, admittedly, but it does illustrate the very wide difference between the digestive tract and the lungs. PG and VG are both sold in good quality and are labelled: Propylene Glycol, USP (or BP or EU) Glycerine, USP (or BP or EU) It is possible that a USP product can be either pharma grade or food grade. The USP designation only refers to a general production regime and does not cover the exact contaminants as long as the minimum standard is met. So a USP product might be considered safe for inhalation; or it might, on test, prove inadvisable to inhale. The only product that is guaranteed to be suitable for inhalation is a product that is (a) designated by the manufacturer as Pharmaceutical Grade, and that (b) also has a provable license for inclusion in a specific inhalable medicine. Needless to say this is virtually impossible to locate for the individual buyer. A vendor would be able to buy e.g. Dow Optim glycerine in quantity, for mixing down (or its PG equivalent), and be assured the material is suitable. This however doesn't take into account the nicotine base carrier PG or glycerine. As a practical example, the FDA has warned that glycerine marked USP may contain toxic components from biodiesel byproduct manufacture, and currently there appears to be no way of determining whether or not a USP product contains biodiesel byproduct glycerine. Only synthetic pharma grade glycerine can be be assumed to be free of such contaminants at this time. PG Only propylene glycol of pharma grade should be inhaled, no other grade is suitable. All other grades contain contaminants. VG Glycerine should only be inhaled in pharma grade, which is often synthetic. The use of the term VG to describe the glycerine we use for inhalation is probably obsolete now, and stems from the early days of e-cigarette use when there was little use of Glycerine USP and DIYers had a choice between vegetable-source glycerine and animal-source glycerine [1]. Pharma grade glycerine for inhalation - the only type that should be used - is frequently synthetic [2] and therefore absolutely pure, so its origin is irrelevant. [1] Glycerine can be made from a multiplicity of sources including animal carcases, biodiesel manufacture byproduct, palm oil, coconut oil, a combination of vegetable sources, or synthetically. [2] To see more info on pharma grade glycerine, google 'dow optim'.",

The float has limited movement due to two snap rings spaced about 1.5"" apart. The float measures 1.1"" so tripping occurs within 0.4"" of its pictured location. In reality, tripping probably occurs within a 0.25"" to 0.375"" of the end stop ring. One thing not clearly understood from the description is that the device uses a very high reliability reed switch contained within the stainless shaft. Reed switches are activated by an external magnet that, in this case, is contained within the float. My long term concern for this part is the ""E"" clips seem to be made from plated steel and may rust over time. The rest of the device probably will have extremely long life provided the reed switch contact ratings are not taxed. However, if the liquid being sensed has a lot of contaminates, then a possible buildup of contaminates might occur between the shaft and the float's hollow opening. Some periodic cleaning maintenance might be needed based on the application. The jury is still out on my usage but the device is working very well.",

The second and what I only figured out today after my test facility told me they couldn't get it to work on their system is that you must run this program in XP SP3 compatibility mode.

After all this is accomplish a more expensive meter might have been a better choice but hope is not lost just stick with me. To finally read data on your computer screen you will need to have installed any serial converter to USB driver. Because of the nature of what I do this was done on my PC well before I ever bought this meter but this is a relatively rare driver. You can find this driver here (http://www.drivermax.com/driver/update/Ports/Gigaware/Gigaware-USB-to-Serial-Cable/481626) take care to download the drive and not click on the deceptive add in the page.

open-ended,B005LD2ADQ,"Jun 18, 2014",1403074800.0,"How does it work on HEAVY, 4 years of constant, closed door smoking room (walls painted and carpets cleaned already)?","Sara, I have used ZEP for the past few years as a quick way to freshen up the car or a bedroom from smoking odors. It will neutralize the smell of tobacco that is in the air, via a chemical reaction (more than just masking with a scent). However, this product will not remove smoking odor that has become saturated into fabric such as carpet, or drywall material. The only effective method to extract impregnated odors is by using a high quality ozone generator (over 3000 mg/h). For the price ($89.), this unit: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007GS3T8O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=KTA1084TTDPH&coliid=I18A6OYCZC1QV9 does an exceptional job. You will need a good room fan, and you must leave the house for 4 hours or more because ozone is toxic at this level. However, it dissipates quickly when the doors are opened, and it's safe after a few minutes of exposure to open air. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, smells after flooding, mold (including toxic molds), and the stench caused by just about any other rotting substance. And hotels use them to get rid of tobacco smoke. A good ozone generator will absolutely remove the odor of 4 years of constant smoking in a closed room. There isn't any kind of spray in a can that will do it. I hope this helps you.",

In general, an object which is mostly transparent (like most protozoans) often images well in the darkfield. You probably know this, but just in case you don't: the idea is to replace the fully-illuminated field from your current condenser which shines on your objective lens (creating the white field you usually see), with a thin ""ring of light"" which is designed to NOT hit the objective lens -- so if you try it out with an empty, blank slide, you won't see anything ... because there's no light reaching the objective lens. But when you have an object on the slide, it DOES catch the light, and it is the lights being bounced of the image that you will see, as a brightly lit image against a dark background field. Using it is fairly simple: you just undo the locking screw for the regular (lightfield) condenser (be careful when doing this, and support it with your hand so it doesn't fall when the unlocking screw releases it). Then insert the darkfield condenser in its place and lock it in securely. MOST IMPORTANT: as the other reviewer said in their answer, the customer service folks at AmScope are very knowledgeable, very helpful ... and very patient. I have had to ask them a few questions when I couldn't understand something, and they have always been a big help. So if you are still having trouble, don't hesitate to call them.

What else would I need?,"Correct. The adapter screws directly to the camera without a lens and it keeps camera stationary in the vertical tube of your microscope. Note that the image quality through the adapter is much poorer than through the eyepiece. Especially with a full frame camera (Canon 6D, 5D or 1DX) you will get very bad distortion on the outer 50% of the image making it practically unusable. You'll get much better results using an ""afocal"" setup where you use camera + lens focused to infinity to shoot through the regular eyepiece. Setting that up is trickier as you'll need to get the camera to just right position and block any extra light, but the results will be much better. Finding a suitable lens is also tricky, you basically need a lens that has very short front optical elements (so it works close to your eye). In general older 50mm manual focus lenses work best, I'm using an old Olympus 50mm lens with a Canon adapter. Got all of them from eBay for $30 :) If you don't care about image quality too much, this adapter makes for very convenient way of taking pictures through the microscope.",

I believe a 6 cfm would be better. I started with a 2.5 and had trouble getting to 28hg. the 6cfm does it fast. There is only one valve for suck. The other valve is a thumb release, to release the pressure. I put a 1/4"" brass valve and connected a 1/4"" npt quick change. then i used a barbed fitting that would be used on a quick change and attached 1/4"" vinyl hose. i did the same on the pump for easy breakdown. It is important to have a valve on the suck. This valve shgoul;d be closed when you turn on pump then open. When you are done vacing close valve then turn off pump. This keeps the chamber from receiving contaminant blow-back from pump. This is what i know. Good luck. ps.

Both my Mother and I prefer it for baking and marinates as it sweetens but does not cover or change other flavors particularly fresh fruits for pies, and it leaves ginger and citrus flavors sharp and distinctive with out being sour.

Then there's the objectives, which can be swapped via the rotating nosepiece, and these individual objectives provide three magnifications at 4x, 10x, and 40x magnification. While 1000x magnification is possible, you'll need immersion oil which you put a drop of on the slide, with the oil coming into contact with the slide and the objective at the same time to increase the numerical aperture of the objective. If you are preparing semen samples, you'd likely need to dry them out first according to the appropriate preparation protocols, or the immersion oil will cause it to move around, and will contaminate your objective. Additionally, if this is part of research through a university or institution, you need to fill out an ethics compliance form prior to taken part in research which uses in vitro human tissue samples, as well has having a clearly defined testing protocol for handling the tissue sample.

What typically happens is one power supply creates a slightly higher voltage and it ends up trying to carry the load of the entire system and then burns out because the other supply was never sensing enough of a voltage drop to change it's period to allow more current. Then you have a new scenario with a single supply that cant carry the load and it burns up. When you put power supplies together that aren't designed to be used together, they often both blow up.

Makes sure the surface is clean, if you want the concave look and aren't a pro with the gun then use blue glass tape to mask off the line apply the bead, wet your finger with a glove on and smooth the bead.

No regular IR thermometer being sold can be ""approved"" by the FDA unless it is being sold as a thermometer for medical use.

In fact any item that contains a laser anywhere in it (including a DVD player, cd player etc etc) must be registered with the FDA, this does not mean that the FDA has ""approved"" the item.

How far away you can use the thermometer from the object you are temping is really completely dependent on what object you are temping, how big the object is, ambient temp compared to the object being measured and how accurate you are trying to be. Obviously the closer you can be to the object the more accurate it will be in most cases. What I can say for certain is that unless you are measuring a very large object with a high temperature it likely is not going to give very good readings at 20', not many IR thermometers will. To better assist you in your decision making process it may be helpful to know that the D:S ratio on this thermometer is 12:1. This means that at a distance of 12 inches from the object you are temping the thermometer will be taking a reading from the area of about a 1 inch circle. At 36"" you will be reading the area of a 24"" circle etc etc etc. The further you move away from the object the less accurate it will become. At the 20' you mentioned you would be temping an area of about 20"" or almost 2 feet big, plus in this case you will likely then run into the issue of IR heat from other objects you do not intend to measure interfering with the reading as well.

However, repairing chips with standard epoxy is not a simple nor a fool-proof process. The epoxy may or may not stick well with a small chipped area, and even if it does, getting the epoxy shaped exactly right is challenging. The epoxy will need to be sufficiently thick (viscous) to hold its shape, and then you must fine tune its shape with a razor blade during a very short and precise period of time when it has begun to cure but not cured too much. So yes, you can color match epoxy using this product, but that's the easy part. Have fun!",?

My experience with NCV testing, however, is that it rarely provides a reading unless current is flowing (i.e., something is plugged in and operating), in which case you know there's power anyway without the tester. In your specific example, if there's a break in the ""invisible fence"" wiring, there's probably no current flowing, and you'd be lucky to get a clue. Since the tester must be very close to the wiring, and yours is buried, that's a second strike. It may work, but I wouldn't bet on it.

The measurement will just be a negative reading rather than a positive one. To measure amperage with this type of meter, you have to break the circuit and put the leads inline with the circuit. It's not the safest thing to do and I would recommend you purchase a clamp type amperage meter for these types of measurements. With those, all you need to do is clamp around the wire and it gives you a reading.

open-ended,B007N6Z5J0,"Oct 22, 2014",1413961200.0,Are the cows which provide the cream this butter is made from get any grain(how much?) or is it only grass?,"From the Kerrygold website: The vast majority of an Irish cow's diet is from rich, natural grass which grows abundantly in Ireland. Irish dairy cows graze outdoors on grass all day long for up to 312 days a year. In fact, Irish cows graze outdoors on grass for longer than almost every country in the world. Like so much of what we do, our feeding pattern follows the cycle of nature. During the winter, when grasses stop growing, Irish cows are fed dried grass (known as silage). This grass is grown throughout the year, cut fresh and stored to be used when the winter comes. Cows in Ireland calve in the spring and are therefore outdoors, grazing on green grass when they are producing milk. After calving, cows are provided with supplementary feed to help restore protein and nurture them through this period. The majority of our cows' supplementary feed is locally grown crops such as wheat and barley. As a small island, Ireland does not have enough land available to grow certain crops locally; therefore a number of crops are imported. These imported crops comply fully with strict European and Irish legislative requirements on labeling and traceability. Because our cows live outdoors for most of the year, they are free to roam and graze which is a cow's natural behavior. Although this sounds like common sense, in many milk producing countries cows will spend much of their lives indoors. As a result they do not get to eat the same amount of fresh grass. Our cows produce approximately 5,000 liters per annum. In many countries, cows are intensively farmed and milked. An Irish cow's milk `production' is deliberately much lower than in other countries as the Irish dairy system is less intensive than countries wherein dairy cows are kept indoors, fed grain exclusively and are intensively milked. While this may be less profitable, we believe that it leads to happier cows and better products. We find that what keeps our cows happy also leads to happy customers.",

open-ended,B007PR4UUC,"Feb 1, 2014",1391241600.0,What is Maximum frequency?,"The actual -3dB bandwidth is 4.4MHz. You can check the schematics, there is a lowpass filter on each of the two analog channels. For inspecting a digital signal, the analog bandwidth needs to be at least 5x the shortest clock frequency, and 10x is better. After all, if you look at a 2MHz digital signal with 50/50 duty cycle, it requires at least the 3rd and 5th harmonic to approximate a square wave. If the duty cycle is different than that, the spectral content goes up and the frequency required to display it goes up. If you are looking at a digital signal on an analog scope, you are likely looking for things like overshoot, ringing, transient pulses, and glitches. All of those are going to have frequency content -way- above that of the square wave. So with this 4.4MHz real bandwidth scope, I don't think I'd use it for a digital signal above 100kHz. For similar reasons, I consider it barely adequate for audio troubleshooting.",

Thanks for reaching out to us and sorry for the concern our box warning may have caused. I'm not sure if you have ever heard of prop 65, but here is a blog post that explains it in a little more detail: http://www.redmondclay.com/prop65/. Although there is a varying amount of natural lead many of the foods we eat, and we probably would not even need to have it on a toothpaste, we decided to error on the side of caution and put the label on the box. This is why some of the boxes contain the prop 65 warning and some others don't - yet. We plan to put it on all of them to avoid potential costly prop 65 lawsuits. As you will see in the ingredient list Redmond Clay is the base product for Earthpaste and this type of clay has a lot of elements and minerals in it in varying amounts. Here is an elemental analysis of the clay so you can see everything it has: http://www.redmondtrading.com/pdfs/RedmondClay_MineralAnalysis.pdf. Most clay experts agree that the ""harmful"" metals in clay are not bioavailable or absorbable by the body because of the way they are attached to the clay, but we can appreciate your concern. Knowing the properties of clay many peopletake clay as a daily supplement and many books have been written on the properties of this type of clay even with the elemental profile of the clay. Here is another link that talks about the aluminum in clay and contains other links on the subject. http://www.redmondclay.com/2012/what-about-the-aluminum-in-redmond-clay/.

What I found was that if you set the control type to Solid State Relay, it cycles way too much. If you switch the output to Relay, rather than SSR, then it will not cycle as fast because it will assume that it has to let the relay settle some before actuating it again. For mine, that meant that it would stay active for a minimum of about 3-4 seconds before turning off. This stabilized my electric heating element so much more. After that, I was able to get the Auto Tune to tune very well using full PID. So, you don't really need to turn off the proportional part, you just have to slow it down some and that will still give you some good results, at least, better than ON-OFF control.",

Suppose you make a mixuture 10-90 of tomato sauce and distilled water. What will be the pH of the result? One pH division from the original in the direction of pH 7. Soil is complicated. There are solids in soil that may not dissolve in water. OTOH, what does it mean to have a pH where the solute is not water? I don't know. So what I would do is cover 10% of soil with 90% of distilled water and test the pH. The result should be in the ballpark of the soil pH, but moved by 1 division in the direction of pH 7. These simple formula are approximately correct if your tomato sauce / soil have a pH far from 7. But if the formula (add or subtract 1) changes your solution from acid to base, then don't believe it. In this case, you must learn the details of pH and compute the dilution properly.",

yes/no,B009DNE268,8 days ago,,Dentist wants to charge me $700 to 'deep clean' my lower teeth because x-ray shows a piece of tartar below gum line. Can Emmi-dent break it up?,"Hi, Susan. It sounds like your dentist (or his dental hygienist, who works in cahoots with the doctor) has recommended the infamous ""Planing and Scaling"" procedure, which, as you have discovered, is a very expensive treatment for getting rid of tartar (aka ""calculus"") below the gum line. ""Planing and Scaling"" involves the use of a scraper on the end of a cord that causes the scraper to vibrate (oscillate) at ultra-sonic speeds. Think of the scraper as a mini jack-hammer. The hygienist applies the vibrating calculus remover to your teeth by inserting it below the gum line until it comes into contact with the calculus. The ultrasonic waves, along with the jack-hammering effect, works to loosen and pulverize the hardened calculus quickly and efficiently. The ""planing and scaling"" procedure is usually performed in sessions. The mouth is divided into four quadrants: Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left and Lower Right. Very seldom are more than two quadrants done during one visit. The procedure requires a very strong shot of an anesthetic, which numbs the mouth and facial nerves and muscles. When you leave the dentist's office, you will appear to have a severe case of Bell's Palsy. You can expect your face to assume its normal appearance in 24 hours. The reason for such a strong pain killer should seem obvious. The hygienist must insert the vibrating calculus remover deep below the gum line. The gums surrounding the tooth are, therefore, ripped and torn during the procedure. There is much blood, which you will not see because you will be deprived the hygienist's mirror while he or she is working on you. To safeguard against infection as a result of tearing the gums, you will be given a prescription anti-biotic (in pill form) as well as an anti-biotic rinse (medicinal mouthwash, which has a tendency to give your teeth a nice shade of blue). You will be told to use the rinse for one month, or until you run out of it. You will probably be asked to purchase a sonic toothbrush from the dentist -- one he recommends. Of course, you realize that the dentist has a deal with the toothbrush's manufacturer to sell its brand. For every unit sold, the dentist makes a little money. Kickbacks are not necessarily evil, but it does give you an idea of the dentist's business ethics. One wonders whether the dentist's recommendation is a result of want of money or of the true needs of the patient. And if you are offered a plain sonic toothbrush to prevent tartar buildup, then you know the dentist's heart isn't in the right place. Dentists know full well that regular sonic toothbrushes have absolutely no effect in preventing tartar; he knows, too, that regular sonic toothbrush do nothing to eliminate calculus that has already formed on your teeth -- either above or below the gum line. A number of studies have been made to determine the efficacy of the ""Planing and Scaling"" treatment, especially with regard to its ability to impair the accumulation of calculus below the gum line. Statistics show that, when compared to a basic cleaning by a hygienist, planing and scaling provides the patient no long-lasting benefits. A basic cleaning, coupled with conscientious oral hygiene (flossing everyday, being certain to thread the floss below the gum line) is as effective at inhibiting the accumulation of tartar as a round of planing and scaling. ""Planing and Scaling"" or no, calculus will nonetheless form below the gum line over time, causing pockets to form around the teeth. Calculus forms as a ring around a tooth. Your gums are supposed to adhere to the outer surface of your teeth. Calculus, therefore, forms a barrier that prevents the gum from adhering to the tooth beyond the ring of calculus. The gap between the tooth and the gum is called a ""pocket."" The depth of the calculus is measured in millimeters. Healthy gums adhere to the tooth at a depth between 2 and 3 mms. You may have had the depth of your gum pockets measured. A measurement for any tooth 4 and above is usually the springboard for talking you into planing and scaling. You will be told that deep pockets are breeding grounds for bacteria. If your gums bleed, there is a chance that the bacteria can enter your bloodstream, thereby infecting your blood. The infection could lead to sepsis (blood poisoning), which can have serious consequences if the bacteria travel to your brain or heart. Plus, as long as there is a plethora of bacteria in your mouth, your autoimmune system is expending all of its resources in trying to eliminate the offending bacteria, robbing the rest of the body of vital self-healing autoimmune functions. People who have diabetes are especially prone to oral sepsis because their autoimmune system is constantly battling the ill effects of diabetes. At the same time, the body's autoimmune system becomes less effective at maintaining diabetes control, especially at regulating healthy blood-glucose levels. If the bacteria are removed from the mouth, the diabetic will find the disease easier to control. Once upon a time, none of us had a choice but to suffer the growth of calculus below the gum line. But as long as we had regular cleanings at the dentist and followed the rules of daily oral hygiene, we did just fine. But far too many of us do not follow proper oral hygiene and end up with excessive tartar on our teeth. Particles of calcium and magnesium, the main constituents of tartar, are found in saliva. The mouth is constantly awash in saliva, leaving its sediments behind. As the sediment accumulates, it hardens into plaque (tartar/calculi). Before the lucrative procedure of planing and scaling came into existence, excess tartar was removed during a basic cleaning, except the hygienist had to dig a little deeper with the scraper to chip away at the calculus. There was no such thing as ""planing and scaling"" back then. There was no need for the procedure because it was just a routine part of the hygienist's job to get the deep stuff. Clever marketing schemes and money-hungry dentists are working hard at convincing the unaware patient that ""planing and scaling"" is necessary. Exorbitant fees are being charged so the dentist can reap while he can. Eventually, the truth about ""planing and scaling"" will come out and the greedy dentist's source of income will dry up. The Emmi-dent toothbrush is effectively the same thing as the calculus remover that your hygienist uses. The difference, of course, is that the head of the toothbrush does not come into physical contact with calculus below the gum line. Rather, the pulverizing ultra sonic waves traverse from the head of the Emmi-dent down to the root of the tooth, causing the entire tooth to vibrate at ultra sonic speeds. The effect of these ultra sonic vibrations is the breakup of the calculus mass into tiny particulate flakes. Rinsing well will free the particulates from your gums. If tartar is heavy between teeth above the gum line, Emmi-dent sells a calculus removal tool that can be attached to the base of the toothbrush. Its tip is made of porous stone. Holding the tip against exposed tartar has a pulverizing effect. Daily use of the calculus removal tool will eventually removed exposed tartar. The answer to your question is yes, the Emmi-dent can break up tartar. Choosing between the Emmi-dent and ""planing and scaling"" depends on how quickly you want that piece of tartar removed. If you want a hygienist to tear your gums apart in order to reach the tartar with her vibrating chisel, go that route. The removal of the piece of tartar will be quick, but not painless. It will especially hurt in the wallet. But if you're willing to use the Emmi-dent to get rid of the tartar on your teeth, both above and below the gum line, it will work. It won't be as fast or immediate as planing and scaling; nor will it be as painful or expensive. Best of luck.",?

Again, because it is light weight, bending isn't an issue while wearing the vacuum.

The supplied power supply is 15v, 1A. I don't know how it's regulated inside the box, but it's likely that it goes through a second stage of regulation, dropping the voltage to the 12v range...at least that's how I would design it. If you drop the power supply to 12 volts, it'll mess up that circuitry. Even if you were to use a 15v 3A power supply, it's unlikely it would make any difference. Overall power consumption is minimal and going from a power block with a 15 watt capacity to one with a 45 watt capacity is unlikely to do anything. (And it might even hurt things...running a poorly designed power supply far below rated capacity can sometimes cause the output voltage to increase above spec. That might explain why it worked okay on the 12 volt unit.)",Y

Thnx.","I can't specify ""field of view,"" but what I can tell you - that I think is important for you to know - is that when I replace a 10x eyepiece in my low-power binocular microscope (1x objective), the image is greatly magnified from what it would appear through the eyepiece . . . perhaps about 5x as much (50x total?). I really would have liked it to stay the same, but I can understand why it doesn't. If you have a 40 or 50x eyepiece (or so) that you replace with the camera, my guess is you will see about the same picture as you see through the eyepiece. The clarity is good. Of course, it could be better, but probably not for the same price. Now that I understand the limitations, etc., I am quite pleased with it. I built my own lens and stand for it, using the barrel of a cheap flashlight and a double convex lens that just happened to fit the tube perfectly (24mm). I added a diaphragm to increase depth of field, and a baffle between the lens and camera to minimize ""splash"" within the tube. These are all held in position within the tube by O-rings (from Harbor Freight). The added diaphragm requires an additional light source, which I got from eBay for $3.50 (music stand LED lights on flex arms). Works pretty good!",

The MD35A does come with several adapters that I no longer have, but I believe these are all to adapt to larger microscope barrels rather than smaller ones. I would recommend that you measure the I.D. of your scope's barrel before taking my word for it, and also check the info on the adapters that come with the camera. Also, be aware (not necessarily a problem) that the camera tends to increase the magnification and decrease the field of view - roughly the same effect as using a 50X eyepiece. In a scope like the M100C (if it would physically fit) you might even like this result, but I wanted it for a low-power scope, and added magnification was undesirable, as I could no longer get the entire insect (or whatever) in the field of view. But other than that, I love this camera, and have found another way to apply it - to my own home-made 'scope' that I built around it. The imaging is excellent for a camera in this price range.",?

How can I zoom out to 10x view ?","I am not familiar with the AMscope SE400Z, but on my scope my 10X power is in the eyepiece (1X or 2X primary objectives to provide 10X or 20X magnification), and the MD35 is about 5 times the magnification, or 50X. I didn't want that narrow a field of view, but short of messing with the microscope optics, I don't know how to change it. As for myself, I liked the camera; it does take reasonably good pictures, so I made my own lens setup by using a cut-down barrel from a Harbor Freight 9 LED flashlight (which the MD35 fits into quite nicely), and a 24mm dia. double convex lens that replaced the LED section - held in place by an O-ring. Works fairly nicely, but I have to admit that I went to a fair amount of trouble to set it up, and although I like the results, it is still a bit more powerful, with a narrower field of view than I would like. If you are a risk-taking experimenter and can cut the length of the eye tube down, and increase the distance from the primary objective to your subject (lens to stage), that MIGHT get the results you want, but that is risky business with a thousand considerations . . . In other words, I hope you can enjoy it the way it is, or send it back and try to find another alternative. Another possibility is to place a small concave lens (like from an old cheap film-camera's viewfinder?) in front of the microscope's objective lens, and, again, increase the distance from objective to stage . . . ?? That might do it, with a bit less risk/ Dunno.",

So if every ingredient supports good health, why is there a proposition 65 warning label? Proposition 65 is a California law designed to protect consumers when they use products containing harmful materials. Because of the way the law is enforced, California residents are used to seeing warnings where you'd least expect them-at banks, at Disneyland, and now, on perfectly natural products like Earthpaste. The most important ingredient in Earthpaste is Redmond Clay, a healing clay that has been used medicinally since ancient times. Like many natural foods (including peaches and pears) Redmond Clay contains the tiniest amount of naturally-occurring lead. There is a natural products exemption to prop 65 (otherwise organic green beans and carrots would be 20 times over the limit!) but because of the way proposition 65 is enforced, it would be impossible for a small company like ours to withstand the cost of any ""false positives"" from aggressive prop 65 law firms. Thus the warning stickers on Earthpaste. We hate doing it - we know our products are safe, we've seen them help thousands of people, and we use them ourselves every day - but a proposition 65 lawsuit, even one we would eventually win, would be really hard for a company our size to survive.""",Y

You can simply turn off the power head motor and use straight suction from the vacuum. or 2. You can attach the included hardwood floor tool that's designed to be used on all hard floors. Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin Great-Vacs (seller),?
yes/no,B00C44NB1A,"Feb 14, 2014",1392364800.0,I would buy this sweeper if there was an alternative generic bag. Is there? The bags are expensive but the shipping is astronomical.,"Great Question :) Just keep in mind that the Prolux Stealth is a high end 600 dollar plus vacuum cleaner. Dont think of it as a low end 200 dollar vacuum that uses paper bags. Just because we are selling them in that price range remember that most people sell them for 600 plus. So the high end vacuums like this are Prolux, Sebo, Miele ect. They all use a HEPA bag not a paper bag. The reason HEPA bags are so much better is not only does it improve allergies but it causes your HEPA filter to last so much longer. For example the Miele bags are $4.73 each and you will see the Prolux HEPA bags are much cheaper than that. Also the Prolux HEPA bags are very large and last a long time. So lets say you bought this vacuum and started putting low end paper bags in it. You would probably have to change your HEPA filter every 6 months vs. every 2 years with the Prolux HEPA bags. Let me know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs (Seller)",?
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Dec 11, 2013",1386748800.0,How often does the filter need changing and what type of filter does it take and where do you get them?,Great Question :) We actually get asked this question a lot. So how often a filter needs changed really is how much use it gets. It would depend on the type of dirt you are vacuuming and how dirty your home is. The nice thing about a high end BAGGED vacuum like the Prolux is that the HEPA filters last a lot longer than normal vacuums. This is because it uses a HEPA bag and so very little dirt actually gets to the HEPA filter. So if it was my I would probably visible inspect the HEPA filter every 6 months or so. You can prolong the life of a HEPA filter by blowing it out with like a air compressor. I imagine you would need to change the HEPA filter every 1 to 2 years on average. I hope that helps :) Thanks Dustin Great-Vacs (Seller),
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Dec 9, 2013",1386576000.0,How much does it weigh?,Thanks for the question :) If you look in the other questions that have been asked we cover this there but the canister only weights 14 lbs and the hose and head about 4 lbs. So not heavy. Also when vacuuming you are only vacuuming with the light head so its very easy to use. Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin,
yes/no,B00C44NB1A,"Dec 9, 2013",1386576000.0,There is a grey cloth bag that comes with it that has a clamp on the end. Is that a reusable cloth bag?,Great Question :) Yes that is a promotional bag that we added just for orders placed in 2013. That is in case you dont want to use the HEPA bags that come with it. That is a shake out bag that is washable and you dont have to use disposable bags if you use that. However it will make your HEPA filter fill up faster if you use that instead of the HEPA bags. Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs (seller),Y
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Nov 26, 2013",1385452800.0,"bags may be only $29.99 for 10, but with $9.99 in shipping, this makes the cost to consumer equal to cost of meile. any way to reduce this?",Thanks for the question :) If you look in the other questions posted here someone else asked a similar question. I went through in detail and showed that the bags for the Prolux Stealth are the same quality as other brands like Miele and Sebo but were much less in price because they come in a 10 pack. Even with the bags being a lot cheaper if it was me what I would do is this. I would first buy the vacuum on Amazon from Greatvacs. It will come with 6 bags which with how large the bags are will last most people a year. In the box will be a invoice from GreatVacs with a 5 dollar gift card. Then when I needed to order more bags I would follow the instructions on the invoice and use the 5 dollar gift card for more bags. Thanks Dustin GreatVacs,
yes/no,B00C44NB1A,"Nov 21, 2013",1385020800.0,Can the roller brush be removed? I hate when I must Cut hair off with scissors,Thanks for the question :) YES the brushroll can be removed. There are some screws that you take out at the bottom of the head and then it comes apart and you can remove the brushroll. At GreatVacs we are experts on vacuum cleaners and only sell the best vacuums. One of the tips that we give our customers for pet hair is even easier than that. If you go to Home Depot or Lowes and get a razor knife they sell hook blades for them. With the hook blade they work awesome at removing pet hair from brushes. I hope that was helpful :) Let us know if you need anything else. Thanks Dustin GreatVacs,Y
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Nov 7, 2013",1383811200.0,"If it is purchased online, how does one take advantage of the waranty? (Meaning, how do you find a service provider in your area?)",Great Question :) So it comes with the Prolux Factory warranty and we are a authorized warranty service center for them. We stock thousands of parts and its very easy to do :) This is a high end vacuum (vacuums of this quality like Sebo or Miele normally sell for around 700) so the odds of you having any warranty issues are very slim. However in the rare case that you do just contact our service department at service@greatvacs.com and we will get you all taken care of. Also most of the parts are standard vacuum parts that your local service center can order for you as well. Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs,
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Oct 31, 2013",1383202800.0,Where is the park/storage hook on the wand?,Great Question :) There is no storage hook for tools on the main wand. Because this is a high end vacuum it actually has on board tool storage on the canister itself. So if you lifted up the the door on top of the canister you would see the tool storage where the on board tools store. Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs,
open-ended,B00C44NB1A,"Oct 1, 2013",1380610800.0,Where can I buy the bags now that Amazon no longer carries them?,Yes bags are easy to get. They are sold on Amazon and several other sites. To see the bags listed on Amazon for the Prolux Stealth just go to http://www.amazon.com/pack-Prolux-stealth-vacuum-cleaner/dp/B00D2ZJHS6/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1380632674&sr=8-6&keywords=stealth+vacuum Let us know if you have any other questions :) Thanks Dustin GreatVacs,

I found out after purchase the Roomba will not clean an area that big.,"I have had one for three months and it cleans the entire downstairs of our home (1000 ft^2). (That is a kitchen, family room, dinning room, living room and half bath) It cleans until the battery runs down goes back to the charging station recharges itself. It then returns to where it left off and finishes. It takes a couple of hours but it does it all and it does a very good job. The only thing I have to do is empty the dirt while it recharges and when its done. My wife and I were amazed the first few times it did the floors. The surfaces for all the floors are tile with throw rugs all over the place. It even does a good job on the rugs. The only warning I would give is that it does get stuck sometimes: on electrical cords that are loose on the floor, under dining tables when the chairs are in a certain position (but only once--it cleans under the tables really well) and on my daughter's music stand (again only once--it climbed one of the legs of the stand backing up and lifted the drive wheels off the floor) It has gotten clogged and stopped twice: Once when a thumb tack got stuck in the blade of its brush and jammed against the body of the vacuum and the first time we ran it so much hair wrapped around the brush that it got stuck but both my wife and daughter have long hair and it had been several days since the rooms had been swept.

They do mention on the Neato site that if you have upholstery that hangs down in the center of furniture (under a bed or couch , for example), that it might get stuck.

Drilling into them would allow them to rust then. I don't think they'd break if you drilled into them, I've been pretty rough with them and they haven't cracked at all. However, your biggest issue is going to be ruining your drill bit, and demagnetizing the magnet. If you are going to drill into it, make sure there is no steel in your drill bit, as it magnet will magnetize the bit, and all the magnetic dust will permanently stick to it, ruining your bit. Get a titanium bit, or tungsten carbide bit. You should also make sure the bit is as small as possible so that you minimize your chances of destroying the magnet domains of the material.

This gave the tiles extra grip and even though they get high traffic and abuse, we have been very happy with them. They are holding up VERY well and move very little. Like I said, we play tug of war with our very large puppy on them and they move a little, but my other carpet (which was much more expensive, with a carpet padding underneath) moved all over he place and was destroyed within a year. So, I would recommend these tiles and then strong clear duct tape to hold them together better. Without the duct tape they really don't move much because they have a good rubber backing but the tape really stopped most movement. I hope this helps.",

For example, if you wanted to print a background object (cube, whatever) in one color and switch to another for embossed-looking text, this would be possible with close observation of your print and timely intervention. If you need to print colors in a complex structure, it will be extremely difficult to coordinate the filament swapping.",?

In your opinion, what makes the M2 stand above apart from the FlashForge machine?","It depends on which flashforge machine - but the important bits are: this machine has been utterly dependable for me. I run it day in and day out in a university lab - I actually use a Raspberry Pi running octoprint so I can manage things remotely - and to be able to do that, I need to know that every time I click print from a remote computer, that the printer is going to *work*. That means perfectly - the 1st layer height should stay put, the machine must heat reliably, etc. The M2 does that for me. In addition its very beefy frame means that it can hit pretty scary looking print speeds (seriously. get a strong table.) while maintaining a very high standard of quality. M2 also has MakerGear behind it - their support is unbelievably good - Josh, who handles most tech support, responds quickly and helpfully. I have broken a handful of parts on my machine - mostly my fault, not the printer's - and MakerGear usually has a replacement shipped same day. When a part on another M2 at my school failed unexpectedly, MakerGear shipped the replacement parts less than three hours after we emailed them, for free, and talked us through proper reinstallation.

Note that there are two types: (a) the ones that move the printer to its home position and then (b) the ones that tell the printer that now it is a the ""0.0"" position. What I found confusing at the beginning is that after you have invoked the (a) commands, the printer does not assume to be at the ""0.0"" position, and therefore you need to use the (b) commands. For (a) look at the G28 code in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code. Make sure that you can use these codes first, from the manual commands window in Repetier. Hope this helps.

It is designed to be a portable DAC / headphone amplifier, while the DacMagic 100 is designed to be a part of the home audio system and offer better digital audio conversion than the standard DACs built into most CD/DVD/BluRay players and satellite/cable boxes. The DacMagic uses an ESS9023 24-bit DAC chip while the DacMagic 100 uses the higher quality Wolfson WM8742 24-bit DAC chip. I would say that if you're going to use headphones to listen to your PC/Mac, the DACMagic XS is the way to go.

This is because they tested the machine with ABS and not much with PLA. You can buy filament from Solidoodle at a slightly marked up price plus shipping. They explain the reason to be the quality. Basically they believe their filament has a uniform radius though out the spool with no tangles. However I should mention that I have had problems with their Black filament, only and once, being a few millimeter thicker and causing clogs. There are other manufacturers to consider for filament, specially the ones you can order here on Amazon and take advantage of Prime shipping. I prefer Octave filaments that are basically the same quality but cheaper, based on my two years of purchasing filaments from different sources. It's a hit and miss almost with everyone.

Printrbot sells the ""Printrbot Simple XL Upgrade with Spool Rack for Maker's Kit 1405"" right now that increases your build volume to 185mm x 100mm x140mm. This wasn't available when I wanted to upgrade our printer. I was able to extend just the X axis (table side to side) without much effort or cost. I found a piece of T6511 aluminum on eBay that was 4.5""x14"", a 36"" length of 8mm smooth linear rod also on eBay, and a long length of GT2 belt direct from Printrbot. We used all the same table pieces from the original kit. Total cost was under $50 and we increased our print area from 100x100x100mm to 260x100x100mm. We did need to print out wider support ""legs"" as the printer would tip over sideways when the table moved too far one way or the other! You can also increase the Y axis with a little more effort by printing parts for the ""1405 300mm No Sag, Printrbot Simple"" on thingiverse. While I haven't build this one, I feel I've pushed the amount of actual table weight the frame of the Printrbot Simple can take. If I were to extend the Y axis and need deeper table, I would not go all the way out to 300mm. To increase the Z axis, you need two longer linear rods and a longer Z axis threaded rod. If you want to go up much more than standard, you will need to extend the cables feeding the upper portion of the printer. The Printrbot kit adds external support to these linear rods.",?

If you don't mind printing the same part multiple times and iteratively adjusting the 3d model it I'm sure you could end up with something that is workable no matter which software you were running. That being said I don't think it would be great at printing a gear that was less than 10mm in diameter, but this is true of most fdm printers. Also PLA might not be an ideal material for gears, if possible I would make them out of nylon and if that was not avalible I would go with ABS. That doesn't mean you can't use PLA for gears, you could, but they might need to be replaced often if it's a torque application.",

I provide this when you buy from me (I provide everything needed to start mining straight away). Other sellers do not! Eyeboot",
open-ended,B00KLQHSM6,"Jun 9, 2014",1402297200.0,Will this also work in bfgminer? Do i have to type something into the command line to get it towork properly if so? I haven't had good results with cg,No it should run from a prepared bat file with all your mining details. The seller should help you set this up. I do it for all my customers. Make sure you have the anu_freq 270 line or it will be slow. Also make sure you have a PSU that is strong enough. there is cgminer support and bfgminer is being prepared in 1-2 weeks.,

open-ended,B00KLQHSM6,"Jun 23, 2014",1403506800.0,I can't get cgminer to recognize my usb asicminers with the rockminer. usb asics on bfgminer screws up cgminer. Any way to get it to run all of them?,"Don't use bfgminer - use rockminer's custom-forked cgminer on a PC (https://github.com/rockminerinc/cgminer-for-R-BOX) with Zadig's USBtoUART bridge drivers. If you have a Mac, you might have to ask one of the miner devs/search the forums for help. I tried everything, but couldn't get my Macbook (running 10.9.1) to recognize it, even though the same SI Labs drivers work for 4x Antminer U2 on it. However, it works fine on my Lenovo Yoga 2 - just had to install the Zadig drivers and run rockminer's forked script.",
yes/no,B00KLQHSM6,"Aug 31, 2014",1409468400.0,will this work with the bitminter program?,"So I started with bitminer but Haribo (Bitminter pool operator) hasn't gotten around to adding support for the bitminter client yet. However, rockminer has their own customized cgminer module which is about as easy to use/setup. Look up Dogie's guide and it'll give you most of the info you need: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=639030.0 Seriously, its extremely easy to scale - setup one unit and the rest work perfectly via plug and play within seconds of adding them to your USB network. Additionally, any other ASICMINER hardware you add should scale relatively easily as well due to the R-Box's use of the Block Eruptor protocol(anyone else who has a more technical background, feel free to correct me if I'm blatantly wrong - I've found compatibility to be a non-issue when switching between OSX and windows 8.1 systems). As a last recommandation, I might suggest putting some bids in on eBay before buying on Amazon - prices are oftentimes cheaper there depending on the current projected difficulty increase. Use https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty as a reference for buying.",?
open-ended,B00KLQHSM6,"Jun 19, 2014",1403161200.0,"Description shows ""Each unit comes with usb cord and barrel connector for adapting to a PSU."" What does that mean?","Angelo, Your corsair 850 will work fine as long as you have 60watts of available power on your 12V rail. its a single 12v rail so just calculate how much power you are already using on the 12v. If you have a spare molex adapter laying around you will connect the white and red cables to the black and yellows if you are modifying your own power cables. barrel adapter is white n red leads. white will go to black red will go to yellow. the yellow on your psu is 12v power rail. each 6 pin PCIE cable can also support 3 Rockminers. I will be shipping my rockminers out with these PCIE adapter cables, laptop chargers, or with just the barrel plug. these options should be available next week with new prices to reflect the costs of these various adapters.",

I got mine from Eyeboot, and they did come with power supplies. The Rockminer takes 12 volts at between 5-7 amps and a 2mm plug and it is happy.",
