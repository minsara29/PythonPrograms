Do you see where maybe you could have improved?",Neutral,Positive,"{'happy', 'agree'}"
263,Rose I understand that the client was happy but you know as a senior you have responsibilities to make sure that the team is meeting the deadlines and that communication is clear and then a significant leg in those responsibilities.

264,"Girls, I understand that the client was happy with with the outcome, but it's still necessary to meet Team deadlines and communicate with your team and make sure that you're meeting all the deadlines and again communicating with everybody. So do you feel like you did a good job with that sore areas for improvement there.",Neutral,Positive,"{'happy', 'good'}"
265,"So, yes, you know, we're we're very happy that the client ultimately was satisfied. But when we look at the project as a whole there's a lot of things that we can do better and the quality of work is not negotiable. We need to do better working for this engagement working on the client e y as a whole expects the highest quality and we did not deliver at this time in your role is a senior. I'm looking at it from a management perspective in a manager role is your responsibility to make sure that we're executing and we're meeting deadlines and there are several times on this project where technical issues weren't brought and as a result we had to rework things and it push back the time line. We were significantly over deadlines and over budget on this in a future State, you know, I'd like to understand why you think you can do better off and do you understand what needs to change in order to meet that high quality that we need? We're striving to achieve.",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
266,"So ultimately yes, the client was satisfied but we need to do better project wise as a whole, you know, being the manager on this account or a manager on this account requires that you are responsible for meeting the team objective and deadlines and staying within budget even as a senior within your current capacity. It was your responsibility to make sure that we were executing what we needed to meeting our objectives and staying on task, you know, you mentioned a learning curve with the, the technical competencies and that's something that proactively you need to reach out and let me know if you need additional resources, you know, I'd like to understand what do you think you can do better on your side? Do you understand? You know what your responsibilities are? And do you understand the areas that we need to improve the next project?",Neutral,Positive,"{'whole', 'yes'}"
267,"So Rose. Yes, ultimately, the client was happy and that's great news, but there's a lot of things that we can do better on our side, you know, being a manager means that you're taking responsibility for the team's actions and staying on task and meeting deliverables and that didn't happen even as a senior in your current role. It's your responsibility to make sure that we are executing what we need to within the time frame that we need to if your responsibility to be reaching out if you need assistance or resources due to a learning curve, we didn't stay within budget. We didn't stay on timeline and ultimately this project could have been done a lot better. What on your end in the future. Do you think you can change that? You can do better on your end?",Neutral,Positive,"{'happy', 'great', 'yes'}"
268,"So grows, even as happy as the client was with this we can do better as a whole, you know being the manager on the account is your responsibility to make sure that we are staying on task and that we're staying within budget that were meeting our deadlines and objectives even as a senior in your current role, you know, that is your responsibility to make sure that we are within our budget that we're getting what we should you know, you mentioned these technical you learning curves and that's something that again on your end. If you're not comfortable with the information working with your skill and fat versus the project alignment. I need you to reach out to me and make sure that I'm aware of that so I can give you additional resources overall, you know, this project was not brought up to the Quality that we can do and we can do better.",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
269,"So Rose in this case, you know, I think that there are areas if we look at the project as a whole yeah, it was successful. But when we break it down there were numerous areas that song from your role. I think we can improve there were areas that you you needed to do better catch these technical issues at the team was processing so that it was identified at that point and we didn't end up redoing the work that we did and that would have allowed us to stay on budget and stay on on deadlines. I think that next time, you know, you're in a situation where you're it's new to you and you feel like you have a learning curve. I need you to proactively reach out so that I'm aware that you need assistance and we can see what resources we can pull you into because your job is to you know, oversee that area and this wasn't something that we needed to do better. So what I'd like to understand from your end is what do you think you can do better in the future?",Neutral,Positive,"{'whole', 'successful', 'up'}"
270,"So Rose. Yes, the client was ultimately satisfied. But if we look at the project as a whole there's a lot of areas that we can improve on.",Neutral,Positive,"{'whole', 'yes'}"
271,"So Rose. Yes, ultimately, the client was satisfied, but I think when we look at the project as a whole there are a lot of areas that we could improve upon, you know, part of your responsibilities just catching these issues that come up from a team perspective and there were numerous times when we had to rework do rework and it pushed back our timeline because these issues weren't caught the first time in workday life was not done properly. That's something that you personally can work on on your side and you know aside from that is also you mentioned that this is the first time that you have worked with these technical issues. It's very important on your end. If you feel that your skill-set is not in line with the project that you're working on or you need assistance and resources you reaching out so that we can make sure you have what you need to be successful in the role. What are your thoughts on that?",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
272,"So Rose what I'd like to understand on your side is you know, why why do you feel that? The client was satisfied? What what feedback have you received on your end? I think the overall from a project perspective they were but I do also feel that there were areas that we could improve that would hire that level of satisfaction and higher the quality. For example, there were several Arabs that were missed on your end from a management perspective. And as a result work had to be re completed at pushed back our timeline and I understand you know, this is the first time you said that she worked on something like this, but I need you to be able to proactively identify when you need assistance. Then when we need additional resources so that we can bring those into the project and stay on task.",Neutral,Positive,{'quality'}

290,Rose turning in quality work on time is a core responsibility of your role as senior. You didn't get the team work up to the technical accuracy on time which caused us to have to rework it and took the project over budget. That's a core expectation of your current role. I really see quite a disconnect in getting you promoted to manager. And before you get the senior role to an excellent level.

294,"Hi Rose, so there's a number of things that are important you mentioned client satisfaction is important and it is but being able to catch the claims technical work is critical because you weren't catching the technical errors. We endured rework which took the project over budget. This is a significant expectation of your performance at your current level senior, and I really feel like you have some room to grow before your accurate and reliable in this area. We need to get you firm on firm footing a senior before we can even begin to consider promoting you to manager.",Neutral,Positive,{'reliable'}
295,We are also happy that the client is pleased Rose but there is more to being a manager than just pleasing a client delivering quality work and ensuring that your team is delivering these deliverables on Showtime is also the utmost importance this didn't happen with this particular engagement the project had a significant amount of rework and the budget when significantly over plan. Do you understand? This is an area that you need to improve.,Neutral,Positive,"{'happy', 'quality'}"
296,"We're all glad with the client was pleased Rose. However, there's more to being a manager than just pleasing a client one important part of being a manager is ensuring that your team is delivering quality work on time. I felt that in this engagement your team was not delivering quality work or on time. There was a lot of improvement that needs to be made from this team that you're not having double work. Unfortunately the budget for this engagement was significantly over by the time the engagement was over. Do you understand areas where you might need to improve on before becoming a manager off?",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
297,"We are all really happy that the client is pleased with your work Rose, but there is more that too just there's more to being a manager than just pleasing the client delivering quality of work and ensuring that the team doesn't have to do real work is also very important that didn't happen on this project your team. Unfortunately had to do a lot of rework and the budget was significantly over when it came to the this engagement. Do you understand that these are two areas of improvement for a future reviews?",Neutral,Positive,"{'happy', 'quality'}"
298,Client satisfaction is important but it's not the most important one of the most important things when it comes to being a manager is being able to lead your team on their behavior on your behavior and the overall team performance. I felt that well. Yes. This was her first time managing the team from a technical perspective. There were areas that are in great need of improvement. For example Rosie you need to be able to manage the team so that way you're not having rework that was a big problem with this engagement. There was a lot of rework that was necessary and the budget the project budget went very much over the scope off.,Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
299,Rose's it's important to understand that while the client may have seemed happy. There were a number of items that you missed in the technical review that caused the the project and the project team to have to read off to work which led to more hours and the project went over budget that is not acceptable nor is quality work. It is not negotiable. We have to do quality work and also deliver it on time and within our budget it's important that you understand that those are things that you did not do on on this engagement and they led to the engagement not being successful from an internal standpoint. This is something that you need to own and take responsibility for in your role certainly now is a senior and in before you could be considered for a promotion going forward.,Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
300,"Rose it's critical that you understand that the expectation is that technical Excellence is not negotiable and that meeting our deadlines to our clients is not negotiable. So all of it is important the tech expertise as well as the client satisfaction, they really go hand-in-hand. It's important to understand that your performance and missing some of the technical items in the review cause the project to go over budget were not meeting our internal project metrics that is an issue going forward. And so that's something that is a disconnect between your perception of the project performance and the reality of how that engagement went wrong. And so it's just important understand that again quality work is not negotiable.",Neutral,Negative,"{'missing', 'not'}"

These are things that you're going to need to do to make sure that that our meeting and exceeding the expectations that are required I could tell you from my own experience when I was in in your shoes. It was really frustrating to not be able to get promoted when I thought it was a long time. I felt that it was really important to just get on the next project and prove that I could learn from those mistakes and the shortcomings from the prior engagement and make sure I didn't make those mistakes going forward. I think what was most helpful was getting the feedback from my counselor and really taking that as an opportunity to learn and grow and make sure that I was doing the right thing and then I was able to get promoted and move forward.

What are some ideas that that you have that you think might be helpful going forward.

1490,"So yeah, I think that's a great idea. I think that we can definitely adapt so that both ends are math.

Can we commit two times that you would be online and times do you need to be offline and then look at the work load and make sure that the client needs are going to be covered within that time frame that you'll be off and see if we have additional coverage.

Would that be something that will help you meet your thoughts deliverables?,Neutral,Positive,{'absolutely'}
1496,There's no problem flexing the schedule and understand expectation for the client as well. Right?

1497,"Hey Ryan, thanks for trusting me in the share about your thoughts. It's important to understand how we can accomplish the client's needs right? I thought would be helpful.

1499,"Hey Ryan, I was saying, you know keeping up with the deadlines. I think first you need to prioritize what needs to be accomplished off for the day for the week and focus on those items that are critical and have more priority and we can do that together at the end of the day of the week determining what a priority but laying out all your tasks and determining and what order you need to tackle each of them and put due dates on your calendar for when they're do so that even if you are watching your toddler, you can know exactly what you need to focus on for the day.",Neutral,Positive,{'up'}
1500,No problems flexing the work schedule. But first let's set some guidelines to see what is possible from you. I would like to have a clear understanding what you expect in order for us to meet our internal deadlines and you to be successful.,Neutral,Negative,{'no'}
1501,There's absolutely no problems in setting up a flexible work Arrangement.

1502,Hi Ryan. Yes.

1505,"Absolutely, since we're all working in the remote environment, we can definitely Taylor the work schedules to match your needs. Obviously all of us have different requirements at home. But if you can give us give me some more information on how you would like to work and what kind of schedule that you want to follow we can definitely arrange for that to happen and doesn't always mean that you have to work nine-to-five in the day. You can always work flexible hours as long as you're able to get the deliverables done on time.",Neutral,Negative,{'mean'}
1506,"And in previous seen Ryan shared his struggle to balance work and childhood while working remotely he's about to ask for your help. This scene is about setting expectations through influencing guys your team member toward the adoption of a specific behavior. No, thanks. That's helpful. I am wondering what to do about it, you know and how I can keep up with the deadlines of this engagement. So could we do something maybe adapting the work schedule?",Neutral,Negative,{'no'}
1507,"Yes, I think it makes the most sense that we try to create some more work-life balance for you. We can readapt your schedule. I do recommend that we reprioritize things a bit though. I would like to know what your current engagement priorities are. And when the deadlines are and then we can work on revising your schedule together.",Neutral,Positive,{'yes'}
1508,"Sure. I definitely think we can readjust your schedule so that you can balance both work and home life. I suggest that we map out the good work priorities first, and then we can bring in additional support if needed. So the engagement doesn't get their engagement isn't further impacted.",Neutral,Positive,{'good'}
1509,I think that's actually a real reason a reasonable request. How about we set up a project tracker and teams and we can create a task list that'll help. Both of us stay connected and then I can help page where I see you may have some type of prioritizing problems. Is that going to be helpful for you?,Neutral,Positive,{'up'}
1510,That's a great idea. I think we can absolutely flex your schedule. Let's look at the list of tasks that you've got and we can then discuss the commitments that you've got and set some expectations and ground rules for what we need to do to accomplish both and meet your needs at home as well as the internal commitments we have with our stakeholders.,Neutral,Positive,"{'accomplish', 'absolutely', 'well', 'great', 'idea'}"
1511,"Hi Ryan. Yeah, I think that might be a great idea. I think we can absolutely talk about flexing your work schedule so that it can, date both requirements of the project as well as the demands. You're facing at home. Why don't we sit down and look at a couple of dates and tasks that you have do and think about how they might fit into the calendar.",Neutral,Positive,"{'absolutely', 'great', 'well', 'idea'}"
1512,"Hey Ryan. Yeah, I think we can definitely work on adjusting the work schedule. I think with that. We just need to make sure that we set reasonable expectations and ground rules. So often that, you know, we're both very transparent about what what the work schedule means.",Neutral,Neutral,
1513,"Hey Ryan, happy to adjust the work schedule.",Neutral,Positive,{'happy'}
1514,Right and thank you for suggesting the flexible work schedule. I'd like it if you could outline what your availability is and what you would be able to do and then I can outline some guidelines of what's necessary and we can come up with a formula to make sure that you're a success and that the engagement needs are still met.,Neutral,Positive,"{'right', 'success', 'up'}"
1515,Brian thanks so much for the idea around the flexible work Arrangement. Why don't you outline for me what you are able to do and I can compare that and set some guidelines off so that we can make sure you continue to be a success and that the engagement needs also get met.,Neutral,Positive,"{'success', 'idea'}"
1516,Brian I think of flexible work schedule is a really great idea. Let's work together to come up with what you think you can do and I'll bring forward the guidelines on what needs to happen so that we can make sure you continue to be successful and that the engagement needs are also met.,Neutral,Positive,"{'successful', 'great', 'up', 'idea'}"
1517,Ryan thank you for your commitment to the engagement and wanting to see that the engagement deadlines are all met. I think your idea of a flexible work schedule is a really smart one will need to make sure that the team clearly understands what your availability looks like and also understand exactly what the best way to reach you is when you're not online should an emergency arise but I really think this is a solution that could work. The flexible work Arrangement is a really good idea. Thank you for bringing it out.,Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
1518,Brian I think it's great that you're thinking through creative ways to solve the situation that you're in and I really appreciate your continued commitment to meeting the deadlines. Certainly am looking at flexing the work schedule is a great idea. Is it something that you have discussed with the engagement leader yet?,Neutral,Positive,"{'great', 'creative', 'idea'}"
1519,"Yep, I think that that is a fair proposal. Have you thought of other solutions that might help you things? I'm thinking are for instance not just being work schedule, but also maybe is it? Getting another team member on the team to help support you. or taking short-term leave. Have you explored any other options?",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
1520,"Absolutely. Absolutely. What I would suggest is think of a scheduled work schedule that works best for you off. Maybe I'm going to if it helps like working late in the afternoon through whatever works for you maybe work on that schedule or maybe if you want to start early in the day and then ran a little earlier than afternoon. That should also work. I mean it's it's most important to make sure you set the right expectations with engagement team. So you have realistic deadlines. You have realistic milestones for each day or each week, right? And obviously we are all here to help you. I would strongly suggest that you were off with your team to come up with a flexible schedule like a doll. I mean early in the day or late in the day like whatever works for you.",Neutral,Negative,{'mean'}
1521,I think it's a great idea for us to think about some flexibility here. And and and where we can make sure you're aligned. So let's take a look at your schedule. Let's take a look at what the expectations are for the this engagement. Maybe I can talk with the engagement manager to see what those are and set up some guidelines and boundaries some specific scheduling outlines so that we can make sure that not only is the team getting that commitment and and the things that they need from you but you're also set up for success to make sure that you're doing what you need for your family is definitely a tough time and we want to make sure that we are supporting what you need. And also I'm making sure that we're supporting the client as well.,Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
1522,"I think that we definitely can work around some flexibility for you. Let's sit down and talk about what those ideas look like set up some expectations some guidelines, maybe look through the skin look through what the demands are and what the needs are for this particular engagement talk with your engagement manager and then just make sure it's aligned with the the needs of the team and the needs that you have for this particular for this, you know for for your remote kind of move.",Neutral,Positive,"{'kind', 'up'}"
1523,I think that we can definitely think look at how we can be more flexible. What's going to be important is that we set some really good guidelines and take a look at those expectations that we have for this engagement. Maybe talk to you in the engagement manager and your team and see what you guys are doing and these ideas that we have for for flexibility. Make sure they're aligned appropriately with this with this particular project so that you guys are you're staying staying in the know of what's happening and you're you're committed to the team but also your scheduling looks acceptable for what your needs are currently with your family.,Neutral,Positive,{'good'}
1524,"Yeah, I think that us being able to look at how flexibility will work for you. I think that's not a problem at all. Let's take a look at some of the ideas that you might have life and I'll look at also your scheduling talk with your engagement manager take a look at what's happening on the team and maybe we can come up with some some ways of being flexible some ways to look at your schedule. That way we can line things up. Make sure they're aligned appropriately for this engagement.",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}

1526,"Yeah, I'm happy to think through some different ideas and solutions. Can you tell me exactly what what do you think would be helpful for you? So what ideas do you have for us to think about flexibility when it comes to making sure that you can continue with the the requirements for the this particular role just just so we can start brainstorm some things.",Neutral,Positive,{'happy'}
1527,"Absolutely. So, you know based on our conversation thus far what do you think that you can do in order to help some help set some specific parameters. Do you think it would be beneficial to have a more formalized schedule share with me a little bit about what you think your future plan would look like or what the adjustments would look like to your current schedule and work full time.",Neutral,Positive,"{'beneficial', 'absolutely'}"
1528,"Sure, I think that's definitely something that we can work on. You know, I think we would need to potentially adjust and have a clear outline schedule with regards to what hours during the day you'll be available and able to assist with client needs and then what hours of the day you're going to be needing to, you know help with the at home type of activities. We could potentially look at maybe starting a little bit earlier or Georgia coming back online a little bit later in the evening to ensure that we ultimately as a team are still meeting those client deliverables.",Neutral,Neutral,
1529,There's no problem in flexing the hours to resolve this issue. I would like to set some guidelines. That way I can understand what works better for you. We don't need to we can set for Thursday we can set. You for your success as well as we don't need to we all can meet the internal timelines that we end the expectations of the client Bots.,Neutral,Negative,{'no'}

You will be successful and we will notWe will we will we will always meet the deadlines.,Neutral,Negative,"{'not', 'no'}"
1531,"Oh glad if I'm hearing correctly adapting the work schedule. Yeah, that can be definitely one of the options that are available but this is something which I need to run it by the team understand what hours the other team members are working on and if it is going to impact anyone else in the team based on that maybe we can we can come up with a timetable Ryan and see if that will be helpful for you to but better perform. What do you say?",Neutral,Positive,"{'one', 'up'}"
1532,"Hi. Yes, Ryan, that's a great idea adaptive for the work schedule you're talking about. Let me talk to the all the other team members and see what the other work schedules are and see if we can ensure that you can work at certain hours which will not impact the team. Let's run it by the team and find out what flexible hours you can work on and which would be helpful for the team without sacrificing any performance.",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
1533,"Ryan I'm totally on board with being flexible with your schedule. Let's set some ground rules. You know, what based of your schedule can be making sure that both seem like some towards your needs along with the fact that you can get our work done on time.",Neutral,Neutral,
1534,"Ryan I think we can totally work on the schedule to ensure that you can both be at home and take care of kids along with getting the work done.

We don't need to ensure that we hit our milestones and give our work done.",Neutral,Negative,{'not'}
1535,Ryan I am on board with that. Let me understand a little bit more what would work best with your current schedule to ensure that both you can take care of the kids along with the fact that you can ensure that we hit our deadlines on the engagement.,Neutral,Neutral,
1536,"Thanks, Ryan. I totally think we can adapt to work state job where we can make your working from home work with your kids along with you. I do want to you know, set expectation up front that we do need to hit deadlines. So I'm I'm on board for that.",Neutral,Positive,{'up'}
1537,"Ryan thanks for sharing. I totally agree with you.

1538,"That's certainly possible. That's a very good idea and we can adjust your schedule to fit your time with your family took keep in mind that there are certain expectations associated with that. So I would expect that. You still need to meet the client deadlines, right? You would still have to meet it to very important client meetings. So there's certain things that you need to think about. If you need help with working out the schedule to let me know.",Neutral,Positive,"{'right', 'good', 'idea', 'certain'}"

Have you discussed this with your current engagement team?,Neutral,Positive,"{'now', 'right'}"
1541,"I'm not on your direct engagement team. I would encourage you to speak with them. I don't think that that's an unreasonable request or goal to set off from being aware that sometimes client deadlines make that unrealistic. However, there's no guarantee and you're definitely worth worth bringing it up to them and talking to them to see if there's something that can be done to make it a more flexible situation for you to accommodate, you know the time with your child and we working from home situation that that is the current reality.",Neutral,Negative,"{'not', 'no'}"
