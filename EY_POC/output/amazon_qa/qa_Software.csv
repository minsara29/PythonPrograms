yes/no,0615179088,"Mar 13, 2013",1363158000.0,I'm taking a corse in japanese but what to suplement my classes with something that i can play while i sleep as a suplement. Is this a good choice?,N,"No because it's not a listening course. It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called 'Read Real Japanese.' There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. It's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations. So both products are good but Read Real Japanese is the one I'd recommend for the purposes you're aiming for and keep Human Japanese for the thing you tinker with on weekends between classes or get it on your kindle so you can read through it on the go."

open-ended,0615179088,"Jul 16, 2012",1342422000.0,Looking for Japanese Exercise Book: Does anyone have any recommendations?,,"You've probably already figured out a solution to your question, but I figured that I would post here because my answer may help others. (Have you found a workbook that you like? If so, please post back.) You could grab an additional textbook that includes exercises, or just the corresponding workbook. Genki is a very popular textbook series that many people seem to enjoy. You could buy just the Genki workbooks to save money, as well as the answer book if you want the answers. You may need to skip around depending on what grammar point you are learning from The Manga Way/Human Japanese. I'm using Japanese for Everyone and I like it, but it is pretty fast-paced, explanations are relatively brief, so it isn't for everyone. It has about 10-15 exercises per chapter, and the answers are included in the back. It's also cheap, ~$20, though it looks like Amazon doesn't have any in stock at the moment. You can also try practicing what you've learned on Lang8.com and get native speakers to correct your diary entries. White Rabbit Press and The Japan Shop (online stores) also have some workbooks you could try. (I haven't tried any of them, otherwise I'd recommend a couple)."

I kind of wish it was more fun and engaging for little kids, but my kids think its kind of boring, but they do it anyway. They are 7 and 4. I have to help the 4 year old because she can't read yet, so its not as awesome as I had hoped, but there's really nothing better."

If it teaches the letters, how many lessons are spent",,"Rosetta Stone allows the student to learn to speak the language, or to read and speak it, or to read, speak, and write the language. I chose the full package. I already knew the aleph-bet, and how the letters sound. If you don't know the aleph-bet, simply pay attention to the shapes of the letters and listen to the speakers give the phrases, and before long, you will be able to figure out the reading, too. I know this because a friend (years ago) purchased the Rosetta Stone Arabic, and those squiggles are meaningless to me, but after a period I could begin to grasp why a certain squiggle is different than another. It's not like Chinese, where there are hundreds of characters to learn; there are only 22 letters, only a few of which have a different form when found at the end of a word; also one letter takes a different sound based on whether there is a dot over it on one side (shin vs. sin). There are sections where spelling entire sentences is required, and those are the ones that I have the most trouble with. Happily, the program scores my answers, and allows me to retake the lesson till I get a score that is satisfactory to allow me to move on (typically high 80's or the 90's). I cheated and took notes on the correct answers (provided when the section is completed) and took the section again, inputting the correct answers, but wish I had not done that for the first time or two once I found out I would actually learn the words better for having to learn how to spell them. (For example, I spelled it so many times, I'll never forget the Hebrew word for ""toy"" in my life!) Once I learned how valuable the spelling is, I started the program under a different name (several students are allowed, and my wife isn't interested in Hebrew, so they are all me). Once I get to the section with the spelling, I'll take it the honest way, which is to say, by trial and error till I get a good grade."

I found I was really struggling with Rosetta Stone until I took a few days to learn both Hiragana and Katakana phonetic writing systems (46 characters each, but the sounds are the same). Once I did that, the whole thing made complete sense because I could match up what I was hearing with what I was seeing. Japanese as a whole is not an overly complex language; it doesn't have a lot of exceptions to the rule, but there are some significant differences with a language such as English. Before you spend this kind of money on something a child may or may not stick with, I would strongly suggest using the web to see how they take to learning Hiragana and Katakana. There are some excellent apps out there for iOS (Dr Moku's Hiragana and Katakana apps, for example)."

Are there prostitutes?,Y,"I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the 'Sacramento Trail'. Maybe he meant 'prospectors'. I think it's a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on ""Windows 95"" in my youth but it works with my ""Windows XP"" laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won't run it. You could try stuff like 'Doss Box' but that is a route that you probably don't want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it's not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, ""Oregon Trail 2"" is the best version of the ""Oregon Trail"" series."

yes/no,B00004UCUS,"Jan 1, 2014",1388563200.0,Will this software work on windows 7?,Y,"If I'm not mistaken, it will depend upon if you're running 32 bit or 64 bit Windows 7. The Pajama Sam game, along with the other Humongous Entertainment games of its time, runs in 16-bit. Windows operating systems are able to emulate back one generation, so 32-bit can emulate 16-bit, but 64-bit can only emulate as far back as 32-bit. So, if you're running 32-bit Windows 7, you'll be able to run the game just fine off the disc. If you're running 64-bit Windows 7 (or any Windows OS), the game will not natively run off the disc. That said, there are work arounds available. There's a program called ScummVM. If you get the game, you can pull certain files off the CD, and this program allows you to run the game, even on a 64-bit system. For more info on that program, visit http://scummvm.org/ Hope this helps. Enjoy!"

XP with SP2 is a going proposition. Microsoft is many patches ""ahead"" of plain-vanilla SP2, so caution..."

Research of Windows XP states requirements for installation, and it recommends PC with 300 MHz processor 233 MHz minimum. 128 MB of RAM or higher recommended (64 MB min. support, etc.........requirements vary based on your particular pc and what is installed. I replaced my XP software because of what I was using it for. It is not for internet or browsing, but used in my sewing room for my embroidery machine software. It is older and wasn't compatible with the newer Windows products. To upgrade my particular sewing software was going to cost upwards of $1,000.00 + so I chose to try and find XP. This was the suggestion of a Computer Tech, and was happy to be able to find the package. Microsoft upgrades but they don't think about people that have other uses for their computers other than internet, surfing, etc Hope this helps, but if you aren't knowledgeable about this stuff like me, seek help from the professionals that is what I did."

I'm back on here right now trying to make sure I get a FULL - NON OEM version I can actually use for parallels mac. On the other hand, if you're just running a PC and you just need an Operating System (OS) my understanding is that an OEM version of Windows will work just fine.

yes/no,B0002W2UMW,"Mar 14, 2015",1426316400.0,Can I create vector files with this?,?,"Hello Jolene, I copied this from the Paint Shop Pro 9 ""Help"" section: About Raster and Vector Graphics Computer graphics are of two types: raster (also called bitmap) or vector. With Paint Shop Pro, you create both raster and vector images. You can also create an image with both raster and vector layers. It's important to understand the differences between the two data types. Raster Images Raster images are composed of individual elements, called pixels, arranged in a grid. Each pixel has a specific location and color. If you magnify raster data, you can see the individual pixels as squares of colors. An object in a raster image is defined by its pixels. For example, the front door in an image of a house is made up of a mosaic of pixels at certain locations in the image. In bitmap images you edit pixels rather than objects or shapes. Raster images can display subtle changes in tones and colors, so they are most often used for images like photographs and digital artwork. Raster images contain a fixed number of pixels, so when you magnify the image you are magnifying the display size of the pixels. As a result, raster images can display jagged rather than smooth edges if magnified on screen or printed at a large magnification. Vector Graphics Vector graphics or images use geometric characteristics-lines, curves, and their locations-to define objects. For example, a door in a graphic of a house is made up of a rectangle with a certain width and height at a specific location and filled with a certain color. In vector images you edit objects or shapes rather than pixels. Vector graphics do not lose clarity or detail when scaled to any size or printed at any resolution. They work well for technical illustrations or corporate logos. Choosing Raster or Vector In Paint Shop Pro, you create and edit raster and vector data on separate layers. With some tools you create raster data (like brush strokes with the Paint tool) and with other tools (like the Text and Preset Shapes tools) you can choose whether you want to create raster or vector data. In general, use vector objects when you'll need to edit the object as an element separate from other parts of the image. For example, if you add a star to an image, you may want to change its size, color or location. This is easier if the star is a vector object. You can create raster data on separate layers so you can easily edit or move them. To apply tools or commands to vector objects that work only on raster data (such as the painting tools or the effects commands), you can create a raster selection of a vector object. Then, paste the selection to a new raster layer.

What you do is select ""text"" (icon is T). Then you select the font you like; the numbers signify the number of sts in the height of the capital letters (lower case are shorter, of course). Some of the fonts come with options in the height (such as 8 and 13). Now click in the upper L (or wherever you want) of the empty grid and start typing your poem. As to the picture, I think you mean can you scan and import. Yes. Be aware that the piece will come out in several hundred colors (with their appropriate symbols). This will be way too many. Manually condense the colors to simplify and shorten stitching time. I like no more than 25 colors; YMMV. If you keep all the colors, you'll have to use blended needles for some of the colors. (I hate doing this! Ugh. My mom is ok with blended needles...) mb"

The cost for a Relaxing Rhythms with Iom finger sensors is $299 as the set price from the manufacturer. You can find various options here on Amazon. Make sure to check the feedback, return and guarantee policies such that you align yourself with the most helpful and respected merchant as you might require assistance in the installation process."

I'm not able to comment on the other product you mention. We started our project a little over 10 years ago. MC was the best one we found at the time. For health reasons and others, it has taken us a good while to complete our project, but we've found MC 4.0 and 5.0, even as old as they are, still great resources. Easy to use, quite a few recipe layout options, 5.0 has more complete nutrition information, places to write notes/family anecdotes at the start or finish of your recipe, flexibility with the ingredient list, in case you are using something not included there or are using another recipe as an ingredient. I imagine 9.0 is even better, more updated, though like I say, I can't speak to it directly. Hopefully someone else can help you with that. Good luck with your project. CV"

In fact when I glanced at the product page on Amazon just now, it showed such an adapter as an item ""frequently bought with this one"". Just a caution: we used this during a driving trip in Portugal last year, and while I was glad we had it, it was painfully dated in places. Portugal has been aggressively building lots of beautiful new highways, and Garmin apparently doesn't know about all of them yet. If I were doing our trip over, I would still use this, but I would also get a quality current paper map (e.g,. Michelin) and plan my routes ahead, rather than entirely relying on the Garmin to pick the best path to a destination."

I have used it for about a year now. It came out later that the one for windows so when windows came out with PE7 for windows I called adobe and asked them if it had more features in the windows version and he said that PE7 for windows was the same as PE 6 for mac because the mac version came out later it had all the new features first. It has many of the features of the much more expensive full version of photoshop. There are online tutorials to help you learn it and there is tech support. I bought it originally for under $100 and upgrades are cheaper. If you do a search you might find it cheaper. The new version of Iphoto is also very good. It comes free with the new macs or it is part of Ilife 09. I have looked into Adobe lightroom and Aperture 2 and have not been persuaded that they are necessary for me. PE6 for mac has raw support for many cameras . Hope that helps. Ron

They have a deal where you can add on the BDAG and the HALOT O.T. lexicon in a bundle and save a substantial amount of money, as it costs way more more to buy them individually.

However, looking at their web site, WordSearch appears to be more like Logos software, which I also use. Logos does some of the things that BibleWorks does, but also contains a *lot* of reference (and otherwise) books in electronic form. Preliminarily, WordSearch looks a lot like Logos. Michael"
yes/no,B000EGHMKG,"Mar 24, 2015",1427180400.0,Are any of the greek bibles in BW9 interlinears?,Y,"Yes. You can actually click a button on the tool bar and display your morphologically tagged Greek text in the interlinear format. So you can essentially use, as it seems from me playing around with it for a few minutes just now, any Greek text that has a morphologically tagged companion text. I would have to mess with it some more to answer more questions on it, but it does have interlinear format options, and they are even labeled as such. Again, there aren't any specific interlinear Bibles per say (such as the Jay P. Green Interlinear Bible), but there is a feature to use your desired text and display it in that type of format. I pray this helps answer your question."

For reference works Logos contains more information and resources. For ease of use, both are okay, but to use all of the features I find Logos a little unwieldy. It probably depends on the application you have in mind and your own training as to which is ""better"". I have personal devotions and do the fundamental work for passage research with Bibleworks, then I use Logos for commentary and reference consultation. If you want quick verse finding, Bibleworks. If you are adept at Biblical languages, Bibleworks. If you want a lot of detail from reference works and commentaries and don't mind a little more effort to find it, Logos."

Came here today to ask my own (different) question and only saw this today. 1. The Spyder2 Express calibrator and software creates a color profile that loads into your OS when you bootup your computer. This color profile adjusts the color settings displayed. It's important when using Spyder2 to find and remove from your OS other color profiles that may have gotten loaded, such as Adobe RGB, or a profile with imaging software, or one that came with your monitor. To see if you have a profile loaded, in WinXP, go to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings&gt;Advanced&gt;Color Management. 2. The Spyder2 Express is designed to be used with a computer monitor, not a TV. There are other color calibrators designed to be used with TVs (and maybe with both TVs and monitors--I don't know, I have no experience calibrating TVs).

Ramiah Kandasamy, although both Mac and Windows use intel chips, there is additional hardware in mac computers to make this work. This hardware is not found in non-mac machines, so if you want to do this you can, but you have to hack things as stated previously. Do realize that by doing that, you'll void any support from apple. If you're comfortable working around a computer, you probably don't need their support anyway. If you're not that familiar with computers, either install windows (or linux, which is more difficult to use) on your machine or sell it and buy a mac. Now again, there are things you have to realize when running a mac. The world of software caters to windows first, everything else a distant second. You'll sometimes find yourself scrounging around for drivers for peripherals that come standard with windows. Sometimes, you'll have to work a little to find an equivalent piece of software. If you're into games, realize that a ton of great games simply are not made for the mac."

A full install of the Parallels toolset opens up access to the Mac disc drives. Although a Windows virus would not infect the Mac environment via Parallels, it is possible that using an infected Windows Word to edit a Word doc on the Mac would definitely lead to a Macro virus infection of .doc files on the Mac.

I did an interview with my late grandfather for a high school history project nearly 20 years ago and though it seemed a daunting assignment at the time, I'm very glad I did so. The cassette tape is the only recording any of us have of him, and I've found it enjoyable to listen to every few years. His story was WWII-centric, as he was a recon pilot and I was aiming for a more historically based interview. I think I had prepared about 10 questions beforehand which gave us a general direction. Of course if he wanted to go a bit off topic, who was I to say no? My advise is to bring over a couple sandwiches, a list of questions both broad and specific and just record whatever happens. Since you have the benefit of much higher technology than I did, you have the freedom to edit out dead air or (dare I say) mindless ramblings. :) Since you say she's sharp that probably won't be a problem though. Many people are a bit wary or self conscious of discussing their life with a tape recorder- start with more lighter fare before attempting to delve into more personal matters. You may want to ask them beforehand if any topics might be verbotten to them. She's not a part of the MySpace generation, understand that many things may be her business and her business alone. You most likely understand her personality and shouldn't have a problem knowing when to press for more information and when to leave a subject that might be uncomfortable for her.

open-ended,B000HCTYTE,"Jan 24, 2008",1201161600.0,"32/64 Bit Question, probably been asked to death but who knows. Hey everybody, I heard somewhere that Windows Vista Ultimate comes with both the 32 bit AND 64 bit versions of the OS?",,"Here's an interesting article I found on the tech-recipes Web site: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1426/vista_64_bit_or_32_bit_version_x64_vs_x86 What the author said makes total sense to me. I am posting the article below: Deciding which Vista version to install can be a difficult decision and can really limit what you can do with your system. Here are practical hints which should help a user decide which version to install. I decided to write this guide after installing 64-bit and 32-bit vista systems on several test boxes. With the gaining popularity of 64-bit chipsets/processors, many users now have the ability to run either 64-bit versions (x64) or 32-bit versions (x86) of software and operating systems. However, if you only have a 32-bit processor, your choice is easy... You can only install the x64 version of Vista if you have a 64-bit processor. For those with 64-bit processors, it seems obvious that installing the x64 version of vista would be ideal. The x64 version has increased security based around the 64-bit structure and programs compiled for 64-bit processors will likely run faster. What's the problem with installing Vista x64 on a 64-bit system? 1. Most hardware does not currently have 64-bit drivers. Out of all the boxes that I have installed x64 Vista on, I could always get it to boot up. However, the lack of 64-bit drivers for many hardware devices typically left me without any chance of burning DVDs or listening to audio. Networking devices and card readers were frequently not supported as well. Vista x64 is pretty but it's not very fun without network access or audio. 2. In Vista x64, any driver that is not properly signed will not be able to enter the kernel and will fail to load. Think how many times you have ignored that warning that a certain hardware driver is not properly signed. With vista x64, if your driver has not be blessed by Microsoft, it will not work. Forget about it. I have tired to get around this by booting with the F8 option Disable Driver Signature. It doesn't make a difference. 3. Vista x64 currently does not backward support most x86 (32-bit) drivers. For the most part 64-bit systems run 32-bit applications very well. However, vista x64 doesn't run x86 drivers... at least at this stage. 4. Vista x64 does not support 16-bit software. You may think that you never, ever run 16-bit software. However, XP actually handles this legacy fairly well. 5. Very little x64 software currently exists. x64 software runs better on a x64 system with an x64 OS. Currently, however, there is very little x64 software out there. If you have that magical combination, you do get a nice performance boost. Currently, however, this combination is way to far ahead of the curve. Conclusion: Most users with 64-bit hardware should install the 32-bit (x86) version of Vista. Vista x64 is the turning point for operating systems as they transition to 64-bit. Currently, however, the majority of users will be very disappointed by installing Vista x64. The lack of 64-bit drivers for most current hardware will be very disappointing and frustrating to most users. Why push for 64-bit now anyway? The performance gains promised by 64-bit will not be seen for years until 64-bit compiled versions of software is the norm."

And at the cost of buying the software, unless you've got a really new PC, it's probably better just to order a new one that ships with Vista if you're shooting for the Ultimate edition. Case in point, you can order a dual-core desktop from Dell for around $580 with a free upgrade to Vista Business. Or you can buy vista ultimate for $400. The computer is the more expensive route (obviously), but Microsoft has decided it's more fun to screw over the computer enthusiast who builds his own computers than it is to provide fair pricing. There's no way Dell is paying anywhere near the recommended retail cost of Vista. Anyway, I've rambled. You'll need a separate copy of Vista for each computer."

Booting from the resulting burned CD is just so cool in which you can play around with the desktop and THEN decide if you want to commit. The Ubuntu LiveCD detected EVERYTHING I have hooked up in my USB chains without a hitch. And it just looks pretty and functions great! I may be a Linux newbie but I definitely like what I see so far. This is how it should be! And, if there's a command line that needs mastered, I can handle that for I am a DOS veteran. For ease of use this is defnitely something to check out. Heck, it even appears to run better than XP-Pro, much less Vista. More details as I continue to experiment. And, for those who want a taste of the wonders of OSS check out OpenOffice.org.

If Bill Gates thinks he can make more billions by charging for a license for each PC then that's the end of the road for me."" Every single version of Windows since 1.0 has been licensed this way. Windows Vista is no different. If you've been using that same (set of) Windows install disk(s) to install on multiple machines WITHOUT purchasing additional licenses, then congratulations, you're a criminal! How's it feel? Instead of letting your software run your computer, why not let your computer run your software for a change? There are free (as in freedom; liberty) operating systems available today, one of which is GNU+Linux (that's the GNU operating system plus the kernel called ""Linux""). There are GNU+Linux ""Live CDs"" that let you try the operating system before you install it on your machine, just to make sure you're going to be able to use the OS. One such Live CD is available at http://www.gnewsense.org/. If you don't have CD burning capability, let me know and I'll ship you a Live CD at no cost to you. Free software is software that comes with the freedoms to use it, modify it, learn from it, and redistribute it any way you want, as long as you don't deny anybody else these same freedoms. If you decide you like GNU+Linux, you can install it on a thousand computers, all from the same CD(s), without ever being forced to buy extra licenses or pay anybody any money of any kind. Don't worry, it's legal, and actually encouraged! The developers of free software want people to be liberated from the tyranny that proprietary software subjects its users (and other developers) to as much as possible, even if it means these developers don't get paid for their work. Free software really is a social, humanitarian movement. If you have any questions whatsoever, please feel free to contact me via e-mail or Jabber at: cparker -at- binaryfreedom -dot- info"

Even with all its warts XP does run most of the time. Vista is the worst pile of crap microsoft has foisted on the public since Windows Millenium. Incompatibility with existing programs is by far the least of the problems you will face. Vista manages to hang and require a manual power down reboot about 5 - 9 times a day. MS Office 2007 manages to hang it about 75% of the tie, with Word and Outlook being about equal at being the cause. The rest of the time Windows Explorer stops responding forever. This happens on all 3 of the machines I have that are running Vista. Two of the machines are new and were shipped with Vista, the third was upgraded from XP Professonal. Vista is visually stunning and has some nice features, but when you spend as much as 5 hours a day waiting on hangs and manual reboots it loses its attractiveness very quickly. The Microsoft rep. from Redmond who presented a training session for IT pros and consultants in conjunction with the launch stated that he was sure that Service Pack 1 would be released by April or May and that it should address the stability problems. Well, its now almost October and the stability problems just keep on rolling along with no imminent release of a service pack on the horizon."

I ordered this about a month ago and I just got an e-mail showing that the delivery is pushed back another 1-2 weeks. I'm wondering if Amazon really does have them at all.
open-ended,B000HKMQ64,"Sep 1, 2013",1378018800.0,Does the DVD include Don's Joe Fonebone cartoon? What is the quality?,,"Hello Christopher! I haven't forgotten you. I've been in the hospital and I haven't felt quite up to the task yet. I will go through the '60s material as soon as I can, but I am certain that the cartoon is there. They have simply taken everything including special issues and put them conveniently on a disk. It is well done and even easy to add to an pad. After I read my iPad issues I will delete them and add other issues from my main computer. I am an. Astronomer and plan to buy Astronomy magazine on a disk as well. Every issue all the way from 1973 is on there. These all inclusive disks are a good way to keep multiple issues for life without having to have massive amounts of storage space for hundreds of magazines. And your issues won't rip and tear and you won't spill coffee on them ( or I hope not for your iPads sake, ha, ha!). The MAD disk loads easily and to me is a treasure. It is about $59 bucks where as Astronomy will cost about $150 bucks,but you get so much. I am glad I bought it because I will be reading material that I missed for the next several years! Sorry about the delay, but I have been really sick lately. Let me know if you decide to purchase before my search and if you do, what your experience is. Russ"

All are very good, but the emphasis is different. I use Elements for processing my DSLR photos using the included Adobe Camera Raw. It is reasonably easy to use and the quality of the results is excellent. I use the PTlens plugin to correct for lens defects and Elements works well with this. I very occasionally like to use a feature that Adobe has left out in order to avoid competing with full Photoshop. Examples include Curves adjustment layers and fully automated batch editing. In this case I switch to Paintshop Pro, which invariably does have the missing feature. If you don't know why you would need these features, you probably don't! I don't use the built in Organiser, because I started using Picassa (free from Google) for this purpose and I see no reason to change. For design work, such as web design, I would personally choose to use Paintshop Pro, because its feature set is more complete, (Paintshop Pro 8 is roughly equivalent to Photoshop version 6), and because those advanced features are more easily accessible. Other people that I know would choose to use full Photoshop instead, and I can understand their point of view. Photoshop Elements needs quite a powerfull (i.e. new) computer, if it is not to seem slow. I understand that this is also true for the latest Paint Shop Pro.

I did an interview with my late grandfather for a high school history project nearly 20 years ago and though it seemed a daunting assignment at the time, I'm very glad I did so. The cassette tape is the only recording any of us have of him, and I've found it enjoyable to listen to every few years. His story was WWII-centric, as he was a recon pilot and I was aiming for a more historically based interview. I think I had prepared about 10 questions beforehand which gave us a general direction. Of course if he wanted to go a bit off topic, who was I to say no? My advise is to bring over a couple sandwiches, a list of questions both broad and specific and just record whatever happens. Since you have the benefit of much higher technology than I did, you have the freedom to edit out dead air or (dare I say) mindless ramblings. :) Since you say she's sharp that probably won't be a problem though. Many people are a bit wary or self conscious of discussing their life with a tape recorder- start with more lighter fare before attempting to delve into more personal matters. You may want to ask them beforehand if any topics might be verbotten to them. She's not a part of the MySpace generation, understand that many things may be her business and her business alone. You most likely understand her personality and shouldn't have a problem knowing when to press for more information and when to leave a subject that might be uncomfortable for her. I'm sure there are a number of books out there on interviewing skills, but you're talking with a friend not a head of state- have a genuine talk and just see what happens. Sorry if I rambled.."

yes/no,B000J16PGS,"Dec 8, 2013",1386489600.0,Can you resize recipes?,?,"Yes, Marilyn, you can resize recipes... it's called ""scaling recipes"" under the ""help"" section of MC 8. It can be done in several places, but most common is when you're in the ""edit recipe"" mode. Here's the instructions as given by MC 8: Recipe Scaling scales individual ingredients to change the total quantity produced by the recipe. MasterCook lets you input your own number of servings and your computer will adjust the ingredient amounts appropriately. This will often come in handy, but note that for a variety of reasons related to food chemistry, some recipes simply will not turn out the way the recipe author intended when you scale them. Souffls and other delicate foods are nearly impossible to scale. Some culinary experts warn against scaling complex recipes by more than a factor of two and against scaling recipes for baked goods at all. But for those recipes that can be scaled: To scale a recipe: 1. There are many areas and situations where the Scale feature is activated. The screen where you'll probably use the Scale feature most often is the Recipe Edit screen. 2. Click the Scale Recipe icon on the toolbar. 3. A box appears prompting you to enter a new number of servings. 4. Type in a new serving size and click OK. The ingredient amounts are adjusted to accommodate the new number of servings. In addition, the measurement units are also changed where appropriate. The cooking time and pan size are not adjusted. Hot Tip: Scaling affects only items in the Amount column. Be sure to check values such as pan sizes and cooking times which will need to be adjusted manually. 2004 ValuSoft, a division of THQ Inc. All Rights Reserved."

If you really want to get down to extensive editing the (Superior Drummer albeit more expensive) offers more but I've found for my projects EZ Drummer fits in rather well. And if you want to, you can also create your own Midi files to trigger the kits."

yes/no,B000L3APBK,"Jul 4, 2014",1404457200.0,Is this compatible with garmin nuvi 1490?,Y,"Yes, the UK-Ireland micro SD card worked amazingly well with the Garmin Nuvi 1490. I used this SD card on a trip to Ireland in July 2013. We drove from Dublin to Cashel then Adare (our base for 6 days) where we day tripped to Bunratty Castle, Dingle, Doolin (to go to Inish Orhe [the smallest of the Aran Islands], Cliffs of Morhe, then to Ennis for dinner), Kilerny National Park, back to Dublin, Howth & Dalky. All in all just over 900 miles over a 10 day period. If you are going to Ireland my three caveats are 1. use the 1490 on roads you know before you go as it can sometimes be querky on how things are named if you are not imputting an exact address (never failed with an exact address or GPS coordinates); 2. driving is on the left with right hand steering - learn my friend Tom's mantra, 'hug left, cross right' (it will make more sense once you're actually driving); and 3. rent the smallest car possible that will be comfortable for your journeys (the roads are extremely narrow, often single lane [outside of cities], and often very winding."

This is great if your going to Ireland. I know my way around most of England and didn't need to use it that much. When I did use it, at times it wasn't very clear. But never the less it beats asking two guys in a pub and getting different directions!"
yes/no,B000L3APBK,"Feb 3, 2014",1391414400.0,Is it compatible with a garmin 265wt. Is this the latest maps out,?,"That is not the Garmin I have, but I would think a micro-slot is a micro-slot and they would be compatible across the board. As far as Great Britain goes, the roads don't change much unless there is perhaps a brand new housing development you are trying to get to. We found it very helpful. The only problem was one B& B in Wales which didn't have a good address. The tiny village was listed under the name of the larger town next to it (probably where the post office is). That took some calling around to find but we were still helped immensely by the GPS maps. Once there, we could record the place using the locator feature. Hope this helps."

Both the 255w and the 295w have Micro-SD slots. The City Navigator UK/Ireland comes as a Micro-SD card inserted in an SD adapter so don't panic when you see an SD card that is too big for your Micro-SD slot--just pull out the Micro-SD chip from the adapter.
open-ended,B000L3APBK,"Dec 9, 2012",1355040000.0,Looking for GPS for Ireland What is the best for country and city driving.,,"We traveled in Ireland from Dublin to Cork to Killarney to Ennis/Shannon in September 2012. Purchased the SD card for my older Garmin which I took with us rather than renting with the rental car(too many fees, not covered by insurance and so on). It was one of the BEST travel decisions we ever made!! Someone suggested inputting coordinates into the Garmin so I looked them up on line in advance. The first day we need to find our hotel(street name only) it took us right to the spot and announced ""arriving at ..."" We truly would have missed it otherwise and just traveled on. The streets are often long, sometimes the names have changed, or winding with a lost of round abouts. The highlighted routes let you know that you are driving in the right direction and tell you which exit on the roundabout to take. When we took a ferry, the car was shown driving across the water! The only time there was a ""hiccup "" with it was when we were trying to get to the Burren. It wanted to take us on many very small back roads. Several locals told us ALL GPS's have this issues so ignore it and follow the directions they gave us. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this little investment more highly!!! When you are there and use it you will immediately understand why we rated this so highly. It is truly invaluable!! Don;t leave home with out it! You will marvel at its ability to keep you on track and you will have much more time to enjoy your time there instead of getting lost and/or wondering if you are going the right direction."

The advantage of buying the pre-loaded micro-SD version is you are all done. Its just plug and play (or so I read). The disadvantage is the pre-loaded mem card version can not be upgraded which is why I bought the DVD. The DVD version can be updated and they even have a life time update/upgrade you can buy which is what I will likely do if I decide to update the euro maps but I am happy with the results so far. That said, it seems just about everyone, including me, has trouble doing the install from the DVD so it is likely that you too will need to call support but they are nice enough and got me through it. It will take you a few hours. You do need to check the FAQ on the Garmin site carefully to assure that your model can have these maps added to it and to confirm that your unit can accept an 8GB card as you will need one that big to get the maps installed.

You will want to make sure that you get the latest version of this software that Garmin has published, and it will not be easy to tell in advance if that is what the vendor will sell you. If you want to make sure, order it directly from Garmin, or contact the vendor directly before ordering to make sure that they intend to send you the correct version. Since I have been caught before, also make sure that the seller is an authorized vendor of Garmin products. Some companies, e.g., Sony, will not honor a warranty or give you a free upgrade if you did not purchase the product originally from one of their authorized retailers.

open-ended,B000NA1V96,"Jun 7, 2013",1370588400.0,what does it mean no operating system?,,"Possibly there is a kind of error or misunderstanding in connecting ""no operating system"" with Corel Painter X software, and not necessarily on your part. The term ""no operating system"" is sometimes used with a PC offered for sale, where the seller is just selling the hardware but does not include the operating system, such as Windows, Linux or iOS (Apple products). Corel Painter X is available for different operating systems (Windows and MacIntosh come to mind), but the actual software is different for each version. Some software detects what your operating system is, and installs the appropriate code, or informs you that you do not have a compatible operating system on your computer. So, my best guess, since this is not common terminology (I checked Google pretty closely) for describing software or its use, it is not properly applied here and was intended for something else, probably for hardware. The seller may have copied some text from elsewhere, not realizing the mismatch in terms and usage. Hope this helps."

I combined several MiniDVD's (5- 3in) in one DVD (DL). My problem is that I'm using Panasonic HDC-DX1 which creates the MiniDVD's using Blue-Ray format. To keep the High Def mode you are limited in the amount of video you can store in Blue-Ray format since you are not burning a Blue-Ray disk. Using a std DVD (DL) for the most storage I can get about 64-72 minutes (depending on bit rate) of video and keep the High Def quality. Studio 11 will combine the video if you paste each MiniDVD into the timeline separately and then make a new disk. There are lots of options to chose from and you can get more on a disk with lesser quality. One thing to remember the other comments are correct in that creation in Studio takes a long time, so don't give up while you're doing it. I'm using a 3.2 GHZ Pentium 4 with 2 GB of RAM. It took about 20 Hrs (of Rendering) to make a 70 minute Blue-Ray compatible DVD. I've also used Nero 8 and that also takes a long time too. Good Luck"

I use a Garmin GPSMAP 60scx handheld with Garmin's MapSource Topo US maps. I carry the GPS with me in my pack and turn on the tracking when I'm in unknown territory or exploring new trails. This enables me to see and decide if I should turn left/right or turn around when I meet up with some road or other trail. Since it's showing a 1:100,000 topo, I can see contour lines. Later I can review the tracks I made and find my total ascent/decent and review a profile of elevation change by distance. I can save the track on the GPS and upload it to my Mac to share with other GPS equipped riders. Using the TOPO US on my Mac, I can also find trails that might be suitable for later explorations. Plot a route over the trail and then transfer the route to my GPS so that I can find and follow the trail while in the field. Sometimes however, the trail shown on the map no longer really exists since the digitized topo map is based on older topos and nature tends to grow over trails that have not been maintained or were purposely closed. The GPS has really enhanced my ability to explore and discover new riding terrain. If it did as much for my strength and endurance as it has for my field orientation and ability to know where to go, I'd really be krankin up and down everything! Hope this helps. Paul"

I would say that you're wasting money especially if you're not using the automatic statement/balance downloads from your bank. I've never used the feature, but I do have a couple of mutual funds/stocks stored in Money and it does a good job of updated them automatically. The only thing is that these features have to be renewed through software upgrades/purchases about every two years or else you have to input the data manually. I'm currently using Money 2006 and recently tried Money Plus. I really didn't see anything significant except maybe the program startup time. It continued to display the same erroneous data as my current version. Ex. How many time do I have to tell a piece of software that I pay my entire credit card balance every month? Then when I go in the bills summary, it reflects an amount that isn't consistent with the actual account balance. Is that worth paying $45+ for a new piece of software? I really don't think so. What I will never understand is why can't MS publish something a little more detailed information(like Intel when they release new BIOS versions) to let us know what they did. I think it's because they didn't fix very much in the past 12 months since the last release. What they are doing is charging you money for new versions that may have corrected some (not all) bugs. That's garbage--they should release patches like Quicken does when there is something important. Just my 2cents."

Here's the scoop: The Problem: When entering the activation key for Money Plus, there are a number of boxes which allow you to put in the code. If you find that you can only enter four digits instead of five in the activation code fields, this is because you are using large fonts on your Windows system. To workaround this, perform one of the following options: * Change the font size to the normal (default) size. This can be done through the Windows control panel or by right clicking the desktop and selecting the appropriate option (Personalize in Vista). You should refer to Windows Help for more information here. * Alternatively, copy the full activation key and paste into the Activation dialog box.

This is what they had to say. Thank you for contacting Garmin International. Our newest version of mapping software was released in May of 2007. The title of this update is City Navigator NT 2008. Map updates are released every 12 - 15 months. You can probably expect our next map update to be released sometime in the Summer of 2008. To check for this update please log onto our website www.garmin.com and click on ""MAPS"" at the top of the page. The next screen will show ""MAP UPDATES"", please click on it. This will allow you to type in your 'serial number' in the search field. Type in your serial number and click on 'Find'. This will display your mapping update if there is one to order. If nothing displays this will indicate that your Garmin is already fully up to date. If a map update displays you will also notice there is a link that should allow you to register your product to receive this at no cost. If this is an option your first mapping update will be at no charge. ** Keep in mind for the future, map updates are at a cost. ** Map update can be ordered online from our website www.garmin.com, over the phone at 1.800.800.1020, or in local retail store like Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart etc. The cost for this update is generally around $75.00 to order. This will be a DVD formatted software disk that will be able to load to your computer. You will need a USB cable to connect your Garmin to the computer for the update to complete. This process is said to take around 45 minutes. This update will give your Garmin device updates on streets, highways, construction, restaurants etc. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns regarding this update"

There are no solutions I can find on the Adobe site and although these complaints seem to have been posted since PSE6 was first brought out there are no upgrades or patches to fix what are a myriad of problems. A number of people have complained that the program worked initially and then started continually crashing and that has been my experience. I won't be buying more Adobe products until they show a bit of customer care and isuue fixes for this mess. I have downloaded and installed a trial version of Pro Photo X2 and so far it seems stable.

After I've uploaded them from the built-in card reader in my PC (running Windows XP), the thumbnails in the Organizer appear as ""broken links"" and usually the program crashes shortly thereafter. I've seen complaints about this on various forums but Adobe seems apparently unable or unwilling to do anything about it at this point. It does seem to be limited to this one feature (i.e., uploading .CR2 files) but that is a drag because that is the format I usually shoot in. Otherwise, it's a terrific program.

However, I've read about some bad experiences that other people have had running PSP under Vista. I don't know for sure what the problems are, but I'd highly recommend a clean install of the Paint Shop software if at all possible. I'm in the same boat you are with regard to level of expertise (or lack thereof). I do have a lot of photos on my computer and I ran several of my problem photos through PSP Photo X2 and applied the ""quick fix"" button. The photos were all improved considerably with zero effort and knowledge. I'm pretty sure that with a little practice with the more complicated features I could do more. I have also used PCP Photo X2 do so some web graphics, and the support for layers, JPGs, GIFs, PNGs, and the RGB color model are more than sufficient for my needs (I used Photoshop in college and Print Shop works essentially the same way Photoshop did for the tasks I need it to do). I also tried Photoshop Elements, and the web-centric features of Print Shop Pro seemed far more robust to me than the ones in Elements. In my opinion, nothing even comes close to Print Shop Pro for the price. Finally, if you are interested in doing some detailed research before you buy the software, get Diane Koers's book ""Picture Yourself Learning Corel Paint Shop Pro X2"" and read it. It will tell you all the things you can do with the software and it's surprisingly inexpensive, especially for a Course Technology book. The best part is that after you read it and decide to buy the software (which I'm betting you will), the book will continue to be useful to you as a reference."

Among those testifying were Nina Olsen, the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate. Olsen stressed that the ""freefile alliance"" of corporate tax companies and the IRS had failed to encourage sufficient taxpayer use of electronic filing, and strongly recommended the IRS establish a web portal with a simple electronic template to allow individual taxpayers to file online for free, without having to go through a ""freefile alliance"" company. Then-chairman Grassley and ranking member Baucus (now chairman) both supported Olsen's proposal. Subsequently, the two directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO, Congress's investigative arm) to research Olsen's proposal. The GAO report came out last year. It noted the experiences of some U.S. states and some foreign countries in establishing government-run electronic portals for tax filing. The GAO report concluded that if done properly, a government-run portal could be effective in encouraging more taxpayers to file electronically. What did the current IRS commissioner do upon receiving the report and being required to comment? He simply noted the report's conclusions and made no indication of what the IRS might do to establish its own portal. I think the bottom line is clear: the IRS under the Bush administration is in bed with the tax-preparation industry, obviously due in part to the pressure put on the IRS by Congressmen in the pocket of that industry. It will no doubt require a new administration to give all taxpayers the unrestricted right to file electronically. Until then, we who wish to file electronically for free have to navigate the thicket of pricing schemes and plans thrown up by the tax-preparation industry. This year, I'm pleased to note, TaxACT enables anyone (regardless of income) to download its standard federal IRS software AND file for free! (although you have to constantly click ""no"" to ad after ad asking you to ""upgrade"" to a paid version). And as for state returns, many state tax authorities maintain electronic portals enabling individuals to file their state returns for free, such as my state of Virginia. As many of you know, filing a state return is vastly simpler than a federal return, since states rely on just a few pieces of information from your federal return. Pay a company 15, 20, or 25 bucks to file my state return when I can do it for FREE in ten minutes? No way!"
open-ended,B000W3RSGE,"Feb 7, 2008",1202371200.0,On Line vs. CD Versions: Can you file multiple returns using the on line version of Turbo Tax?,,"With TurboTax Online you have to use a separate user ID for each federal return that you file, which means you have to pay separately for each one. If you have to file for multiple family members, the CD version will cost less. With TurboTax Online, since each federal return is a separate account, you also have to purchase the state separately for each person. If one person has to file in two states, you have to purchase both states for that person. With the CD version you purchase each state once, and you can use it for as many people as need it. For example, if you live in New York, and some family members work in New Jersey, you would purchase one copy of New York and one copy of New Jersey. You would use the one New York program for everyone, and the one New Jersey program for all those who need it. If you buy the Federal + State product, the first state is included at no extra charge, so you only have to buy another state if you need a different state. Again, if you are filing for multiple family members, the CD version is going to cost less."

While I really like the aesthetics and presentation, Pages isn't nearly as good as word for just plain typing. Pages is much, much better than word at page layout, with much better templates and a more user friendly interface, but it isn't that great for writing essays or reports. The spell check is much weaker on Pages, and it misses a lot of simple grammer things that Word automatically corrects, and also a personal issue I have with it is that its default font is Helvetica. Who uses Helvetica? Every time I make a new document I have to readjust the font, which can be a little annoying. Keynote is better than powerpoint, though, in pretty much every way. Numbers is much easier to use than excel, but has much fewer formulas and functions than excel which is pretty important. So, the new release of office is significant because MS has been doing it for a while. Apple's new iwork is better than earlier versions, and is better than office at certain things, but as overall it still isn't equal to office."

But, since Corel abandoned the product I am not sure how it is being marketed. I own both. Real Draw Pro is made by MediaChance and is a good product. However, these programs have very different functions. PhotoImpact X3 is a raster graphics program and Real Draw Pro is a vector graphics program. Raster files will suffer a decrement in resolution as they you zoom in on them and vector graphics don't. Even though that makes vector sound better, you will be better off if you use PhotoImpact for most routine graphics work such as photo editing. I use Real Draw Pro more often for very specialized graphics like logos. I still use PhotoImpact a lot but am slowly weaning away because I do not think it is being upgraded anymore. It will likely face compatibility issues as more operating systems are released (beyond Windows 8) or as programs expand to 64 bit environments. Paint Shop Pro is a nice program. But if you don't mind a little steaper investment you might want to consider either Photo & Graphic Designer or Designer Pro X (http://www.xara.com) . They are hybrid programs that support both raster and vector graphics but they really shine by the way their interactive controls allow you to see changes dynamically as you make them. You can download a trial version and try it out. I hope this helps. Also, I am running PhotoImpact X3 on Win 7 without a problem."

If you are attempting to install the Mac OS on a netbook PC to create a HacIntosh, though, I recall reading of Apple's move to prevent this. The installation program reportedly checks the processor type. If it's an Intel Atom, (i.e. a netbook), it halts all further installation. However, Apple cannot distinguish between Intel processors common to both Macs and PCs.

The box set includes a Snow Leopard DVD, an iWork DVD, and an iLife DVD (keep in mind that the regular Snow Leopard family pack, that's not a box set, does not include iLife or iWork). The Snow Leopard one is only for Intel Macs. I know the retail iWork and iLife versions work on PowerPC, and I would assume that they are *probably* using the same ones, since the installer packages that you could download (such as for the iWork trial) are for both Intel and PowerPC, and since they wouldn't have to put separate files on there it would probably be easiest for them to include disks that supported PowerPC. Then again, I can't confirm this and it is a possibility that they assumed they only needed to include Intel support. One possible option you have is to buy iWork/iLife/Snow Leopard separately. The actual disks that are included in single-license copies are the same as in the family-pack ones, meaning it will install on all your computers. So what you could do is purchase those disks separately (either with family packs or not) to approximate the price of the Mac Box Set Family Pack. Of course, the best option would be to actually call 1-800-MY-APPLE and ask them if the iWork and iLife work on PPC. If not, you could ask them about buying the non-family pack versions separately to see if it's ok. I'm sure they'll be fine with it."

This headset has amazing noise cancellation capabilities, and is fairly comfortable when worn for a long time (you really need good noise cancellation to avoid confusing Dragon). The only issue is that the ME-3 is rather pricey -- about $135 on Amazon. A good alternative to the ME-3 is the Radio Shack 33-3012 ""Headset Microphone with Gooseneck Boom"", which is less than $25 but performs nearly as well as the Sennheiser (this microphone is a virtual clone of the Sennheiser). In fact, I routinely use my Radio Shack and leave my expensive Sennheiser in the box the 33-3012 came in! The Radio Shack microphone includes a long cord extension with an on/off switch, something that is missing from the Sennheiser. Any microphone is going to work best with a ""USB sound pod"" device. A sound pod is an ""active"" device that accepts the 1/8"" male plug on most headset style microphones and plugs into any USB port on your computer. It works as an amplifier (I guess) and provides a much, much better signal than any consumer-quality microphone. I use a VXI ""Translator"" pod I got from emicrophones.com, but the Andrea units are also reputed to be good. Plan to spend about $40 to $60 for a pod, but it makes a world of difference in the quality of Dragon Naturally Speaking dictation. (Without a pod, you're relying on your computer's sound card to provide amplification. Generally speaking, sound cards in most desktops and laptops are very poor at handling microphone input, and are much better at playing music and game sounds.) BTW: Microphone positioning is everything when it comes to speech recognition. The mouthpiece must be moved away from your mouth -- I position it about 2 to 3 inches to the right of my mouth to avoid breath sounds and noises that confuse Dragon."

Prove it to yourself by telling it your ""family History"" and it will digitize it for you.

To answer your question, putting your family tree on Ancestry.com will work fine for you if you want the basic functionality of having historical records located automatically, and recording stories and photos for people in your tree. When you want more functionality, such as printing several types of reports, doing tree-wide searches for specific information, or keeping more detailed source information, then FTM is a better choice. Both Ancestry and FTM work together, so the record hints from Ancestry also display in FTM. You can post your FTM tree as an Ancestry tree, and we're continually working to increase better integration between the two."

open-ended,B001BY45QO,"Jul 10, 2008",1215673200.0,Does MobileMe push Outlook mail from an individual PC or from the Server? Would MobileMe push Outlook 2000 mail from my company issued Windows 2000 laptop to an iPhone?,,"Hi CuriousB! Here is how it works: 1. MobileMe does *not* push e-mails from Outlook on the Windows laptop (irrespective of which Windows OS you use) 2. It does *not* need IMAP or POP access to be enabled on your company's exchange server. 3. You do *not* need to buy MobileMe subscription to get Exchange e-mails on your iPhone. 4. iPhone uses what is called 'ActiveSync' technology licensed from Microsoft. 5. Messages are pushed directly from Microsoft Exchange server through the internet to your iPhone. 6. Microsoft Exchange 2003 Service Pack 2 and later support 'ActiveSync'. If your company uses an older version of Exchange, this will not work. 7. There is no additional configuration to be done by your company, since 'ActiveSync' is enabled by default when Exchange server is installed. 8. However, your company *can* disable 'ActiveSync' if it wants to on the Exchange Server. Most companies I know don't. However, your mileage may vary. You might want to check once with your network admins. 9. Another way to confirm is - if any of your co-workers are able to get work e-mails on their Windows Mobile phones, then you can get e-mails on iPhone too. (Windows Mobile phones also use 'ActiveSync') If you want, you can read additional information from Apple here: http://www.apple.com/iphone/enterprise/ Once again, if all you need are work e-mails on exchange server, you do *not* need to buy MobileMe subscription. Let me know if this helps! :)"

Now some years back just to 'experiment' I've tried different applications on thumb drives plus i also used 'cheap dc disks' and ran many applications from the disk just like many run sega and nintendo games with great success tho the truth of the matter is some apps run fine and some flop totally tho Quicken tends to run very well for me, But please understand thats for me as I have ""no way' of understanding what computer system your using plus its ram hard drive etc,etc, And these capability's vary vastly from machine to machine etc,. My overall experience with running programs from USB drives is 'Not Good' but i have been quite successful by burning programs to cd blank disc's and running from the disk which is a good thing to keep in mind as disks are: 1. Cheap and pretty reliable. 2. Easily availible and you can buy them without attracting attention. 3. If your uses are both 'Private and Super Sentitive the disk can easily hidden or destroyed after use. 4. Some programs that just WONT run on USB will run like a scalded dog from a cd or dvd blank etc,... To Close I' have the greatest of respect for Quicken as its a great program but I cant really quote on Quick Books as I've never used it. But since I've switched to LINUX ive found that if you run WINE program then Quicken and many other Windows programs will run very well and the Hackers along with most surveillance programs cant even touch you, Not that i am a crook but my 'customers and clients' belong to me and to me alone period,. But having had accounting and bookkeeping in school myself let me remind one and all that the best bookeeping system is 1. The one that is simple and: 2. The one that works best for you etc,.

However this is much more complicated (instructions on how to do this are on the Costco website). You have to edit in one color space, then soft proof and convert the profile from the working color space to the Dry Creek profile. This is not worth the effort unless you are selling your prints, and even then ....... My advice, try sRGB with no auto correct."

Both Kaspersky and nod32 are very highly rated but I think nod32 is supposed to use less system resources and may be a better choice if you dont have a high performance computer.

Thanks for taking an interest in our software and for your concern over Amazon remaining a valuable place for people looking to get objective reviews. We've been selling at Amazon for about a year and a half now. Over the course of that time, Amazon has contacted thousands of our users directly, and hundreds of them have responded by posting Seller Reviews. I bring this up because the Seller Reviews--4.8 stars from nearly 300 people--mirror the general feelings of the product reviews. There are a few negative ones in there (one person hated that he had to use the DVD, another experienced a shipping mistake, others had some usability issues), but overall they're very positive. And the only way anyone can submit a Seller Review is if they actually buy a Fluenz program at Amazon, and Amazon contacts them directly asking for their comments. Of course all the reviews on our product pages are real, but I think pointing you to these Seller Reviews is the easiest way to show this. You can read these reviews here:"

I wrote TaxCut with a detailed description of the problem, but have never received a response. Also, I found TaxCut clumsy and harder to use compared to TurboTax.

For example, right now the price of TurboTax Deluxe + State + eFile is $42.50 at the top of this page. If you click on the ""New and Used"" button you'll see a list of other merchants who are also selling TT through Amazon. One has it for $28.99.

How the states have worked in the past is you get one state if you buy a product that includes the state. You can do as many state returns as you want for that state. For example, I live in Virginia and I can do my return and as many friends returns as I want on the software as long as they are in Virginia. My family lives in Kentucky, so I have to buy an additional state for Kentucky, but I can do as many as I want with that state. The e-file fees are separate. You have to pay those fees for each state return e-filed. If you paper file, there are no additional fees for the states once you purchase that state. As far as the federal e-file is concerned, you can use the 5 free for any 5 federal returns that you e-file - doesn't matter who they are. Hope this helps in clearing some of the confusion!

In any case, you need serial number to activate it, or be a trial. Don't know if full or special, as Toast 10 Pro didn't come with a serial for it, at least not on my copy. That's probably because it was a trial to begin. I think you'd be better off with iPhoto (if you don't have Adobe Photoshop). That's Mac. On Windows, Microsoft's photo editor won't cut it--too simple, and often doesn't do what I want it to do. If worst comes to worst (that is, if you have a camera), try your camera's software.

On the other hand if you have purchased Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium 12.5. This is the professional version and it is specifically designed to work with Windows 8 directly without frequent use of the dictation box. Finally to make myself clear if you cannot directly dictate in application all you have to do is say ""open dictation box"". This is if you're just using the home version, and if you happen to own the professional version of Dragon you should be able to dictate directly to a Windows 8 application."

Usually when you record a class you just play back the tapes without re recording the whole lecture.

open-ended,B001RYFYYK,"Nov 27, 2013",1385539200.0,How do I download the DVD to the hand held GPS? I have the disc uploaded to my computer,,"Yes, like Richard says, plug gps into pc. Download and install ""Base Camp"" on your pc. Then you can either click the Icon at the top Base Camp tool bar to ""send to device"", or click on ""device"" and then ""send to device"". Some of the maps (City Navigator) have to be unlocked on line. Be careful, gps's will only hold a limited amount of maps. The Garmin Montana 650T will only display maps if there are less than 3,000 downloaded on it. 24K Region Topo maps have thousands of maps on them so you should only select areas you think you will need and download those maps. Too many and the gps will not work. All else fails, call Garmin support. They are pretty helpful."

I can tell you this: I returned TOPO because I felt it was useless and the producers need to invest time and NOT rush there product to market in the version I had in order to make it truly beneficial.

It is sometimes surprising what will be there and the things that are not. If you intend to hike a national park, for example, it might be worthwhile to purchase a map for that specific park. For example, you can purchase from the Trailhead series. There's one for the Pacific Crest Trail, if that helps. Regarding a trail overlay - If you intend to load the Topo onto your GPS you need to check to see if it can handle the additional info. I use the Basecamp software from Garmin (free download) and with it you can install overlay information. You can also overlay aerial photography."

open-ended,B00271L3BU,"Nov 2, 2013",1383375600.0,How do I avoid losing track for files using the proprietary database naming algorithm? I am concerned about being able to find and access files,,"Each of the items scanned are saved in the system as PDF files, so you always have access to the files. The idea behind Rack-2-Filer is that you have an organization for your scanned items. First, you create up to 3 different ""libraries"", such as Business, Personal, and Other, for example. You, then, create a digital ""notebook"" in one of the libraries. I think each library is limited to something like 1,000 notebooks. Then, you create ""tabs"" inside your notebooks, like you would put tabs in a notebook you'd use for school. Then, you open a tab and scan things under that tab as pages (either one-sided or two-sided). Each notebook can have up to 1,000 pages each. But, if you scan in 5 pages, then 3 pages, then a 1 page document, it saves each ""scan"" session as a separate PDF. So, if you want everything in one huge PDF file, you have to only start one continuous scan. Each new scan ""session"" is considered a new PDF. But when you review your documents under the tabs, you don't get the sense of where one PDF file ends and the next one begins -- you can only see that under Windows Explorer when you view the PDF files under the file structure. So, if you scan everything in 1 by 1, you could have 1,000 PDFs. If you scan one long, continuous scan, you only have 1 PDF, but both would look the same when you review them in a notebook. Hope that helps. If you have more questions, you can contact me at dennis.wiedeman@gmail.com"

If it is installed in any other, Microsoft will not support it. IE. no up dates , nothing. You are also supposed to have a builders certificate to purchase this.

The OEM version is permanently locked to the motherboard or pc it was installed on and cannot ever be installed on another computer. The normal and more expensive version (the one I purchased) CAN be installed only on ONE computer at a time. In order to install it on a second, or third, or etc. it wil have to be removed from te previous computers and you will then have to call Microsoft and tell them you are going to install it on a new PC.

When you buy the more expensive RETAIL version, the key is tied to the user, YOU can use it on as many computers as you want, but it can only be installed on ONE computer at a time with either 32 or 64bit. You cannot install one retail copy on two machines. If you want to replace your machine, you can remove/uninstall it from your old one and install it on a new machine.

Which makes me believe the email is just a smoke screen and something is screwed up... Amazon's story to me: I ordered early, choose super saver shipping, and because of where I live (San Diego CA?) they wont ship the product until five days after release even though the product page says in stock and shipping now. What's up now Amazon? ================================ Thank you for writing to us at Amazon.com. I truly understand your concern. First let me apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please allow me to explain what actually happened. I have researched your order(#############), and can confirm that we still expect to ship your order by the date listed in Your Account: October 26. The estimated date of shipment was calculated at the time you placed your order and is based on the availability of the items in your order, the proximity of inventory to the delivery address you provided and the shipping method you chose. Further, I see that the shipping method selected for this order is our free Super Saver Shipping option. We offer free Super Saver Shipping as an option for customers who don't mind waiting a little longer to receive their items in exchange for getting free shipping. When you select Super Saver Shipping during checkout, the final page of our order form displays the estimated date of shipment for your order. Although this is only an estimate--your items may ship sooner--if the date doesn't meet your needs, you can change the shipping speed before submitting your order. You'll find a link to the details of our Super Saver Shipping offer on the detail page of every eligible item. As noted in the offer details, ""your order may take an additional 3 to 5 business days to ship out from our fulfillment center(s). Transit time for Super Saver Shipping orders is 5 to 9 business days after shipping."" This delay can occur at various steps of the fulfillment process; the extra time allows us to process and ship your order in the most cost-efficient way available, and enables us to pass the savings, in the form of free shipping, on to you. Due to this reason, we encourage our customers to review the last page of the Shopping Cart order form before submitting an order. This page displays the estimated date of shipment and indicates how many shipments will be created for the specific order. If the shipping date and number of shipments is unacceptable, you can change the shipping speed or delete any items that would take too long to reach you."

No, it's not, it's C4DEALZ. When you buy here you will notice that some will say ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"", others will say ""Ships from and sold by *some 3rd party seller*"" and others will say ""Sold by *some 3rd party seller* and Fulfilled by Amazon."" The case with this at the moment is that Amazon apparently has no stock and our thoughtful friends at C4DEALZ see the opportunity to jack up the price by $100 or so and make money off the uninformed, especially in this case because even at that price it's less than buying 3 separate upgrades. Get informed. First clue, outrageous prices gouging the customer (for which Amazon actually should remove the seller as a partner) and you won't see it being available for Free SuperSaver shipping since only Amazon sold or fulfilled items are. In my case I have a gift certificate I'd like to use toward the purchase so I'm rather irritated they don't have stock but I'm not stupid enough to pay C4DEALZ gouging prices, or anyone's for that matter. Now I see that ""The Toy Giant"" has joined the parade of gouging sellers. They should all go on lists of sellers that we will never ever purchase from.

Mainstream CPUs and motherboards made the leap to 64 bits first, with OS, device drivers and applications following only after consumers began asking for the benefits of 64-bit computing. As an example, the machine I'm using to write this shipped with a 64-bit AMD Athlon CPU, 32-bit Windows Home Premium and a paltry 1GB of RAM. I used it that way for awhile before upgrading the RAM and installing 64-bit Windows Vista Ultimate. I understand a few computing devices are still being made with a 64-bit CPU and 32-bit Windows OS. You might find this combination, or instance, in a low-priced netbook that is specifically designed to use only one or two gigabytes of RAM, so there's no benefit to using a 64-bit OS. And you'll find lots of used computers that are built around quite powerful (for the time) 32-bit CPUs; while still more than adequate for almost anything less demanding than image manipulation or gaming, they're forever limited to 32-bit operating systems."

Upgrading Xp 32 bit can be a nightmare! With xp you have to do a clean install. This means the program wipes out everything on your hard drive and you lose everything. Make sure you back up all your files and data. Once installed you will need all the original disks for whatever software programs you were running on xp or be able to download them from the Internet. You CAN NOT install your software programs from a backup. The next problem that arises is when it asks you for the product key to type in DON'T DO IT!!!!!!! Just hit the enter key and bypass this screen. You can install the product key after windows seven has been install on the computer. Here is why, if you type the product key in when it asks you to and windows has already formated the hard drive you may get a invalid product key message. Now you can't go anywhere in the program. If you start all over again windows doesn't find XP on the hard drive because it has already wipe everything off the hard drive and since this is a upgrade it won't install the program because it can't find XP. Now you are going to spend hours with Microsoft getting the problem corrected. I have installed this 8 times on XP computers and it is not easy and it takes up to about four hours to install on some slow 32 bit machines plus you won't believe how many updates have to be installed. Some computers all night to install them. Don't purchase this program until you run The windows 7 advisor program from Microsoft to see if your computer will run it. Some computers don't have the right requirements to run windows 7. AGAIN FIRST THING TO DO IS RUN THE WINDOWS 7 ADVISOR PROGRAM IT IS EASY TO DOWNLOAD FROM MICROSOFT. Once the software is opened up no one will take it back, EVER! I hope this helps. You may want to look at windows 7 system builder instead of this version."

After some search I came across this product on download.com. At first glance, the interface does not look too fancy. But the report it generated was fantastic. It matches all my wash sales. What I like most about it is that all the matched wash sales are highlighted which makes the report very easy to read and I can doublecheck it myself. check it out: http://download.cnet.com/iScheduleD-Portfolio-Manager/3000-2047_4-75147579.html BTW, some guy left a review for this product. According to him, he compared the product's result with Gainskeeper and the numbers are all good. This is what he said, ""Pros: If your an active trader, with multiple brokerage accounts or short positions, this is it. Although this product is categorized as a Portfolio Manager, it really is nothing like feature rich Portfolio Manager but thats a great thing at tax time. Cons: Not an extensive set of portfolio tools by any means. But in my mind this con is actually a strong point. Summary: Its tax time and this tool unlike any other I've seen offers the simplest way I've seen to bring multiple brokerage transactions together, with the ability to quickly modify the CSV files ahead of import for those special positions that require manual-cost basis adjustment. Nothing around I've found to do this, and I've looked extensively.I'll be recommending this to any of my friends that are active traders. Other portfolio tools are for bells and whistles. This is for getting your taxes done accurately and in the shortest time possible. Honestly, brokerages themselves provide extensive portfolio mangagement these days, and if not a Quicken like tool might be desired. But there are many basic tax entries that aren't easily manageable in any of these other tools. This product will quickly streamline imports from multiple brokers, generate your washes flawlessly and spit out 1 nice TXF file. The unlimited version is a great deal for the price. Have short positions that require cost-basis adjustment? This product doesn't natively do that, but its the only tool where since your importing CSV files, you simply add the dividends paid type costs right at the CSV level before import. Other tools are good at automatically recognizing corporate actions like stock dividends and splits. But need a manual adjustment for something like a ROC distribution paid. Your out of luck on the other products."""

Each and every state must be downloaded after the federal tax software has been installed. If one buys TurboTax Federal and State, the first state tax software download is free. If your father does not have an Internet connection, he will not be able to update either the federal or the state software -- and Intuit is constantly updating its software until about late March. If I remember correctly, Intuit will send out CDs with all updates and the specific state(s) required if one calls their customer support line. I strongly suggest that you call Intuit and ask if they still support offline use of their software. TT will print out all forms needed to submit your tax return, whether federal or state, through the mail. The best approach in your situation might be to install the software on a laptop with an Internet connection, and then in late March, after applying all the software updates and downloading the required state(s), lend the laptop to your father for a day. An inexperienced TT user should be able to complete both the federal and state returns in about four hours or less in most cases."

I live in Oregon so the online state version is $36.95 and comes w/free e-file for state taxes. Total $66.90 Looking around the web(amazon) and at local store specials the boxed, off the shelf version, ""TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2009 + efile"" is around $50.00. What I learned on the call to Intuit is that in this version the state e-filing is an extra cost. I did see another post regarding this fee. So the off the shelf/boxed version ~$50.00 + $19.95 for state e-file capability comes out to be approximately the same cost(+$3.05) as doing it online with online state e-file being ""free.""

You could say the Mexican Spanish is ""street"" Spanish whilst Spanish Spanish is ""classroom"" spanish.

After some search I came across this product on download.com. At first glance, the interface does not look too fancy. But the report it generated was fantastic. It matches all my wash sales. What I like most about it is that all the matched wash sales are highlighted which makes the report very easy to read and I can doublecheck it myself. check it out: http://download.cnet.com/iScheduleD-Portfolio-Manager/3000-2047_4-75147579.html BTW, some guy left a review for this product. According to him, he compared the product's result with Gainskeeper and the numbers are all good. This is what he said, ""Pros: If your an active trader, with multiple brokerage accounts or short positions, this is it. Although this product is categorized as a Portfolio Manager, it really is nothing like feature rich Portfolio Manager but thats a great thing at tax time. Cons: Not an extensive set of portfolio tools by any means. But in my mind this con is actually a strong point. Summary: Its tax time and this tool unlike any other I've seen offers the simplest way I've seen to bring multiple brokerage transactions together, with the ability to quickly modify the CSV files ahead of import for those special positions that require manual-cost basis adjustment. Nothing around I've found to do this, and I've looked extensively.I'll be recommending this to any of my friends that are active traders. Other portfolio tools are for bells and whistles. This is for getting your taxes done accurately and in the shortest time possible. Honestly, brokerages themselves provide extensive portfolio mangagement these days, and if not a Quicken like tool might be desired. But there are many basic tax entries that aren't easily manageable in any of these other tools. This product will quickly streamline imports from multiple brokers, generate your washes flawlessly and spit out 1 nice TXF file. The unlimited version is a great deal for the price. Have short positions that require cost-basis adjustment? This product doesn't natively do that, but its the only tool where since your importing CSV files, you simply add the dividends paid type costs right at the CSV level before import. Other tools are good at automatically recognizing corporate actions like stock dividends and splits. But need a manual adjustment for something like a ROC distribution paid. Your out of luck on the other products."""

Each and every state must be downloaded after the federal tax software has been installed. If one buys TurboTax Federal and State, the first state tax software download is free. If your father does not have an Internet connection, he will not be able to update either the federal or the state software -- and Intuit is constantly updating its software until about late March. If I remember correctly, Intuit will send out CDs with all updates and the specific state(s) required if one calls their customer support line. I strongly suggest that you call Intuit and ask if they still support offline use of their software. TT will print out all forms needed to submit your tax return, whether federal or state, through the mail. The best approach in your situation might be to install the software on a laptop with an Internet connection, and then in late March, after applying all the software updates and downloading the required state(s), lend the laptop to your father for a day.

Total $66.90 Looking around the web(amazon) and at local store specials the boxed, off the shelf version, ""TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2009 + efile"" is around $50.00. What I learned on the call to Intuit is that in this version the state e-filing is an extra cost. I did see another post regarding this fee. So the off the shelf/boxed version ~$50.00 + $19.95 for state e-file capability comes out to be approximately the same cost(+$3.05) as doing it online with online state e-file being ""free.""

The thing is that mandarin is a language based on tones as you may know by know-such is the case of the Vietnamese as well.

Elements has more buttons that do things is a more ""automatic"" fashion, while CS5 gets more in-depth with the same functions so that a person can fine tune what they need done. In general, if Elements has a tool or function, CS5 has the same tool or function but does it a lot better. But in some cases CS5 has tools that Elements just plain doesn't have, such as layer masks and compositing capabilities (to name a few). If you are looking for a program built more toward hobbyists and scrapbookers, Elements is the way to go.

He never got an answer to his question. I posted a lengthy explanation on a review of Photoshop CS4 Student Edition. The review is not available now that CS4 is discontinued, but you can still read it by accessing all of the reviews written by The Irish Patient here on Amazon. It's entitled ""If in doubt, consider the academic edition instead,"" and it was the highest rated review for that product. Briefly, the difference under CS4 was that you didn't have to jump through any hoops to activate the $299 academic edition. The $299 academic edition came with an activation code inside the packaging. You were good to go as long as you could get a third party retailer (like AcademicSuperstore) to send you the academic edition disk. With the $199 student edition, all you got was a disk without an activation code. The code could only be obtained by going through Adobe's verification contractor. You had to open the seal on the software and then send your proof of student or teacher status to Adobe. If you were verified, then you would get an e-mail with the activation code. If you were denied, you had to fight with Amazon to return opened software."

What does this mean?,,"Personally, I'm using Photoshop Extended CS4 Academic Edition, but you can be very confident that the full version of Bridge is included in CS5 Student Edition. Even if it isn't, you can probably get a copy for free; see below. Mini Bridge is an addition to CS5 products, not a replacement for the full Bridge application. Bridge through CS3 was pretty much useless. Bridge got beefed up in CS4, but many people thought it was cumbersome to have to switch between separate application windows for Photoshop and Bridge. In CS5, users have been given the option to use either full Bridge or Mini Bridge. My understanding is that Mini Bridge operates directly from the Photoshop application window. Adobe has never treated Bridge as an application that anyone would want to have separately from Photoshop. I haven't tried this with CS5, but in CS4 and earlier you could get Bridge for free by downloading the 30 day free trial for Photoshop. Bridge was included in the trial. Photoshop expired at the end of the 30 days, but Bridge remained fully functional indefinitely. I suspect that you could still do this if, for some bizarre reason, the full version of Bridge isn't included in CS5 Student Edition."

The problem that I had was that when I try using a EVGA X58 + Intel i7 920 Combo and render to the Sony AVC MP4 format it crashes immediately. This didn't happen on my previous X48 computer system. I've tried both Sony Vegas Media Studio 9 and Sony Vegas 8 but both crash on trying to render Sony AVC MP4 format. I've tried just about everything and have the same problem. I've tried reinstalling Vegas, I've tried installing a fresh copy of Vista and then Vegas, I've even tried installing Win7 Beta and Vegas. I've also removed overclock and all default system setting.

I reset the memory flags in vegas80.exe m2tsplug.dll mcstdh264dec.dll sonymvd2pro_xp.dll to ""greater than 2gig"" and did a render of which I almost always crash on (avchd at 1920 render to m2ts 1920@16Mb/s with AC3 audio) I didn't crash!

Chrome is a cloud - based operating system meaning it relies on web-based applications rather than ones installed on the computer. Any storage space on the Chromebook is probably meant to store local media files rather than programs. This program utilizes a Windows - based executable file which would almost certainly not run on Chrome. You will probably have to find a web-based version of this or an alternative, unless you can find a program that will emulate Windows in the Chromebook. There are emulation programs like VMware and Parallels for Mac that would allow you to do this, but I don't know of any similar programs for Chrome at this point. Good luck in any event."

What cable would I need?...,,"Hi Julia...no, the software does not come with any type of cables. The answer to what type of cable you need to buy depends on what type of device you're planning on connecting to your keyboard. For example, if you're planning on using a computer - all computers use a rectangular connector (also known as a 'Type B' connector). You need to look at the back of your keyboard and determine what type of connector it requires. It may be rectangular (like your computer) or it may be square (also known as a 'Type A' connector. This will tell you if you need a Type A (because the keyboard has a square connector)/Type B cable (standard rectangular connector), or a Type B/Type B Cable. The Type A/Type B is most common and is nothing more than a standard printer cable. You can find those for around $6. No need to spend any more than that. Hope this helps."

open-ended,B003VNCROU,"Apr 18, 2012",1334732400.0,"Does it work for interviews, where two people are speaking? Is this possible?",,"No, there is NO voice recognition software that can do this at all well in 2012. You know how when you call an airline or bank and get into arguments with their voice recognition software that tries to listen to what you need? It's a long-term goal to develop reliable voice transcription that can listen to multiple people with multiple voicings and dialects speaking conversationally, but it's not even close to being implemented yet. Right now, the state of the art for voice recognition, which Dragon employs, is that each user develops his or her own personal user profile that gets more accurate the more it's used. Dragon can only use one user profile per session. The software has to be restarted to load a different user profile for a different speaker, so it's totally impractical in a meeting- or courtroom-type setting where several people may speak a sentence or two in turn. Dragon would do a very poor job in this setting without restarting it to change to a different user profile as the speaker changed--way too many errors to be useful. There is transcription hardware available elsewhere that tries to work around this using Dragon and Word. You need a translator, who re-dictates what he or she hears the meeting or courtroom participants say as they're speaking, much like a foreign translator at the United Nations. This person wears a device that looks like an oxygen mask (to focus the input to Dragon to that user profile, and also to reduce the noise in the meeting or courtroom from having another person speak simultaneously). The people who sell this hardware say that it works well and saves years of practice with a stenography machine such as the ones used by courtroom reporters. I haven't tried it, so I can't say if it's a good workaround, though I do agree that in theory, it sounds workable with a little practice on the part of the re-dictator."

(This has been sitting on my desk for a long while because I didn't have the time to do the training previously) I did the voice training and started converting files. Some of the recordings where made while driving and the sound quality is probably below what is reasonable. But even the recordings that were done in quiet areas where my speech is clear and not noisy, DNS generates mostly random words that have nothing to do with what I'm saying in the recording. I'm really disappointed. I'm also glad I haven't invested a lot of time in recording things with the expectation of converting them ""eventually"". The fact it basically doesn't work means the audio files I do have are useless. Even taking the recording I made to do the training and running it through the transcription program generates substantial errors, that are clearly program bugs. About half way through that transcription it stopped using spaces allthewordswereruntogether.

open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,"Nov 14, 2013",1384416000.0,compare dragon to windows speech recognition,,"I tried Windows Vista speech program and nearly threw my laptop out in the yard!

We are still learning each other, but I will say I prefer it to Vista. Hope this helps."
open-ended,B003VNCRNQ,"Apr 19, 2012",1334818800.0,Hands-free editing with Dragon: Is this product a good solution for a writer who has lost the use of her hands?,,"Yes, Pace, it can be used that way. You would have to be patient as you started. You might find it frustrating when you didn't know how to do something or when the program didn't seem to be cooperating. If you can get someone to help you or have another way of operating a browser, check out the videos for Dragon NaturallySpeaking on YouTube to see how it works. To make a correction, I'm looking at your original post. Say you'd stumbled slightly when dictating, and Dragon had transcribed the phrase ""something I'd have to learn elsewhere"" as ""something I'd have to burn elsewhere"". (I doubt it would make that error if you hadn't stumbled when dictating.) Speaking in your microphone, you'd tell Dragon ""Select 'burn.'"" Dragon would highlight the word 'burn.' Since you made a dictation error, you could just repronounce ""learn,"" and Dragon would probably make the correction. If it didn't work, you'd say, ""Correct that."" Dragon would pop down a drop-down menu with about ten alternate words it thinks you might have meant. If you saw ""learn"" as #6, you'd say, ""Choose 6,"" and Dragon would make the correction. If ""learn"" wasn't in the list, you'd say, ""Spell that... l... e... a... r... n..."" [Your spelling would now appear as Choice #1 in the drop-down correction list for ""burn""]. You'd say ""Choose 1,"" and Dragon would make the correction. It would also remember and associate your pronunciation of the word with your spelling, and if it heard it again, it would *usually* not make the same mistake. (Like humans, sometimes Dragon needs repeat corrections of the same error but does eventually get it.) That's also the way you teach Dragon a new word or phrase it's never heard before and can't find in the computer's dictionary. Dragon actually prefers you spell a new or corrected word or phrase aloud than type it in. Dragon isn't trained by typed entry. It has to be spoken aloud (or selected from the Choose Correction drop-down menu) for Dragon to learn. Dragon may come with a few training tutorials, though only enough to get you started; however, there is much more material available online for free on the Nuance website and on other sites as YouTube. Dragon does have a learning curve that I would describe as moderate in difficulty. You need a good headset. The packaged headsets in some Dragon editions are just so-so, and more expensive headsets will perform better with fewer errors needing correction. Dragon gets much better at working with you as you train it and vice versa. If you've ever been to a dog training class, and I don't mean this in any way to be demeaning, as I love dogs, but you realize in a dog training class, the reason that you don't just drop the dog off and come back to pick him up later ""all trained now"" is that in dog training class, you're training the dog, but the dog and the teacher are also training you. So it is with training Dragon. You have to learn it. It does take some practice. Some people get too impatient early on and can't do it. You, Pace, would have a strong motivation to keep at it and would probably do very well with it and find it helpful. In addition to entering text, Dragon 11 can be used to control Word 2003+, browsers, and of course, Dragon itself--by that I mean, you can issue many of the program commands in those programs aloud and they will execute. The premium edition of Dragon 11 can also issue commands in Excel 2003+ without keyboard or mouse. Most other programs, however, cannot be operated by Dragon, so for those you still need some way to input commands such as open file, save, etc. To do this in Word at least, Dragon often also needs at least a computer with a dual- or quad-core processor, and extra memory helps Dragon generally. A ten year old laptop computer or even a new netbook computer may not have enough hardware resources to run Dragon 11 and execute commands in Word well."

If she needs to be able to control the program with Dragon rather than by using a keyboard or mouse, so that she is using Dragon to open the spreadsheet, navigate around the spreadsheet (such as jumping down 12 rows and over one column to select a different cell and make an entry there), save the updated spreadsheet, etc., she needs Excel 2003+, Dragon 11 Premium edition (NOT Home edition, which cannot operate Excel with commands, though Home edition can still enter Dragon-dictated data into the cells), and ideally, a fairly new and powerful laptop or desktop computer with reasonably good resources including extra memory. It will run on an underpowered or old computer, just not as well, and may balk at executing program commands. Even Premium edition Dragon 11 cannot execute dictated commands in most programs other than Word, Excel, PowerPoint, web browsers, and itself-- for that, you still need to be able to use a keyboard and/or mouse.

Also, this is a very basic skeletal accounting software and things like payroll, printing tax forms, or even attaching files to invoices ON YOUR OWN computer requires a monthly or annual subscription service which often times costs many times more than the software. Case in point, enhanced payroll costs over $300 a year on top of the software. Read the high star reviews on here. Then see why Intuit would send so many ""product managers"" to spin greedy marketing practices as ""features"". Read the positive reviews too but you'll notice many of them are suspiciously cut and pastes from the Intuit website.

I am not able to use the email invoice feature that was integrated into the program since 2009. If you still wish to email your client's invoices to them here's how you can do that: When you have you clients' invoice open and ready to send simply click on the menu item ""File"" and on the drop-down menu select ""Save as PDF."" Save your client's invoice in a named pdf file, for example, ""Client ""S"" April 12 2011.pdf. Once you have done that, click on the ""send"" menu item at the top of the invoice and the ""Email Invoice"" menu item will appear at the top of the drop-down menu. Select ""Email Invoice"" and then the email dialogue window will open. Now open your regular email client where you send all of your business emails from. Switching back to the email dialogue window highlight your client's email address by holding down your left mouse button and dragging it to highlight the whole text. Next, press ""Ctrl and C"" to copy the highlighted email address. Now switch back to your regular email client and in the ""To"" field and press ""Ctrl and V"" to paste your client's email address. Now switch back to the email dialogue window to highlight the main body of text by holding down your left mouse button and dragging it to highlight the whole text which may read something like this for example: ""Dear (Your Client): Your invoice for service date 04. 12. 2011 is attached. Please remit payment at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your business - we appreciate it very much. Sincerely, Your Company 000-000-0000"" Press ""Ctrl and C"" to copy the highlighted main body of text to be entered into your regular email client message body. Now switch to your regular email client to do precisely that. Place your cursor where you want the message to be inserted. Press ""Ctrl and V"" to paste your message into the message body field. Next, click the ""Add Attachment"" button. A dialogue window will appear asking you to open the file to be attached. Look for it in the location you saved it. When it has finally uploaded (it will appear as a paper clip usually attached to your email message.) and you are satisfied with the way your message reads, then press your ""send"" button and your client will receive it in the same format as they did using the integrated email service before the support for that will run out in May. The great thing is you can still send your clients' their bills and estimates and any other document that can be generated for your clients in this way and it does not cost you an extra cent. Sure it is a couple of extra steps, but once you do it on a regular basis, it is a ""walk in the park."" I hope this helps you and answers your question. =}:-)"

The only reason I went to this effort is, as stated, Quicken is the now unfortunately only game in town - not that I have anything against Intuit but competition is always a good thing for the consumer - and while MS Money wasn't perfect, my track record was only a few (single digit number of) crashes in over 10 years of use - the last version I used (2007) did have one really annoying bug where it miscalculated my mortgage payment so every month I would have to manually correct the number. I really do want to use Quicken, as the spreadsheet alternative isn't worth the effort; I'm just really concerned that they don't invest enough in test and validation - while a boundary condition, a check for this particular bug should have been in any reasonable test plan."
open-ended,B003YJ78AE,"Jun 3, 2013",1370242800.0,How do I copy a single account from a file containing multiple accounts?,,"It depends on exactly what you are trying to do. If you are intending to establish a new file with just the single account with which you are concerned, then probably the best thing to do is to delete all the other accounts except that single account and save the file (as modified) with a NEW NAME. This will result in two files now: the old multiple-account file and the new single-account file. If it was your intention to add the target single account to another FILE already populated with multiple accounts, I am afraid that can only be done for a limited number of account types (not bank, credit card, brokerage, etc.) such as asset or liability accounts. That would be done by exporting the specified account to a QIF file and then importing that new QIF file into the pre-existing Quicken file."

It's also somewhat faster, and works a lot better for really long dictation. It depends on what you doing with it. If you're going to be dictating stuff a lot, you will certainly want Dragon Dictate. On the other hand, if you're not doing a whole lot, or it's really just a quick dictation, you might want to stick with mountain lion's built in dictation feature. One of the other options, which I would certainly recommend, when using Dragon Dictate is the use of a better microphone. It really makes a difference. I find it to be extremely accurate on my Mac, and overall quite fast. In fact, I just dictated all of this with it. You should really check Dragon Dictate's website. It contains most of what you're looking for, with all of the different features and everything. One of the best parts is the ability to almost completely control the Mac.

Upon receiving your materials, Nuance will issue your serial number or reject your eligibility claim within two business days. I am a college student who got the academic version.

I have used this tool before and it works very well particularly for removing Registry entries. However, I have only used it based on T/S's recommendations. About three to five years ago there were continmuing problems with Norton's software apps (see Customer Reviews) especially Norton Anti Virus. For me the problems always occurred after Live Up Date ran (at least monthly). When I called T/S their solution was always 1. Uninstall the software using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, 2. Run the Norton Removal Tool, 3. Re-Install the software appllication. Starting in 2009 Norton has resolved those problems and my experience has been to just install the new software (the removal tool is not needed). I recently received an e-mail from Norton that provided me with a website that would allow me to update and use NIS 2011 for the remaining subscription time on my NIS 2010. Here is the URL http://updatecenter.Norton.com/manual/AutoDetect While the NIS 2011 installation program was executing I did notice that one of the program steps was ""Uninstalling previous version.""

I have used this tool before and it works very well particularly for removing Registry entries. However, I have only used it based on T/S's recommendations. About three to five years ago there were continmuing problems with Norton's software apps (see Customer Reviews) especially Norton Anti Virus. For me the problems always occurred after Live Up Date ran (at least monthly). When I called T/S their solution was always 1. Uninstall the software using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel, 2. Run the Norton Removal Tool, 3. Re-Install the software appllication. Starting in 2009 Norton has resolved those problems and my experience has been to just install the new software (the removal tool is not needed). I recently received an e-mail from Norton that provided me with a website that would allow me to update and use NIS 2011 for the remaining subscription time on my NIS 2010. Here is the URL http://updatecenter.Norton.com/manual/AutoDetect While the NIS 2011 installation program was executing I did notice that one of the program steps was ""Uninstalling previous version.""

When the software integration with the hardware worked, it was BRILLIANT, because you can plug in with MIDI, and the program knows when and if you missed a note, and can SHOW you what note you missed (or were delayed or ahead) in playing. Spectacular in theory, but buggy in reality, now, since they have not updated it in a while, and the last time I tried it, it was unusable almost (if you use the tracking bit).

But make sure your bios is set to let you boot from usb before booting from hard drive. If your bios is set to boot from usb before harddrive your set. Restart your computer and let the linux load from usb. Once loaded you can play around with it and see if anything does not work or if everythingn is fine.

The reason is I have lost so many important things over the years due to computer crashes and my neglect to backup my data, so as you can see, I try to cover all bases and feel no shame that I have 2 to 3 locations for things that are very important to me.

Windows 7 runs flawlessly, buttery smooth and lightning fast. You will love it. My only regret is I should have made the partition larger. I only devoted 80 GB to Windows, I wish i had devoted 200 GB of my 1 terabyte drive. Also, when you get to the point of formatting the drive during installation when Windows starts, choose ADVANCED and format the partition in the NTSB format.

I am a technical person and removing one operating system with another can be tricky depending upon the type of machine you have. After discussion with a local computer shop I do business with, told me they charge $200 for the operating system and the labor cost to replace. They are doing many replacements of this nature and having difficulty keeping windows 7 in stock for sale because of this. If you are not technical then replacing an operating system may be extremely difficult for you. With some laptops, for example, you have to change some BIOS settings before you can boot your machine from the installation disk. Do your research for your particular machine on how to replace 8 with 7 before you spend any money. Also look into a free program call ClassicShell with makes windows 8 screen look like Windows 7 after installation - start button and all. It has quirks but makes 8 more useable if you don't have a touch screen. Hope this helps. Best of luck to you in your endeavor."

However, the License is good for one PC and one installation, however you can perform an inplace repair installation (by using the upgrade option) by launching the setup program via the installation media from within Windows 7, and if you need to completely reinstall the operating system (where you might re-format the Hard Drive) despite it being activated a phone call to Microsoft's Activation hotline may allow you to use the key again as long as it's on the same computer.

You can buy additional licenses, however. I don't know the details of how to use or take advantage of Microsoft's ""Volume Licensing"". I don't install Microsoft Operating Systems in large enough volume to justify the cost of a volume license. However the idea is you get one product key per machine -- something like that. What you can be sure of is that if you install a Microsoft Operating System from a DVD, be prepared to type in a unique, paid-for product key for each machine you install on.

open-ended,B004YHXXHC,"Mar 2, 2012",1330675200.0,COREL PAINTER 12 Education edition vs regular edition: Can someone please point out the differences?,,"@E. Ocasio -- Sorry, but your honest, reliable friend is dead wrong. It took me about thirty seconds to find the End User License Agreement on Corel's website. The EULA specifically states that the education edition can be used ""only for educational purposes and for no other purpose. Academic versions of the Software may not be used for commercial, professional, or other for-profit purposes."" In the next paragraph, the EULA again states in plain English, ""If this Software is clearly labeled a Student and Teacher, Home and Student or Home Edition ... you may not ... use this Software for any commercial purpose or in any commercial enterprise or business."" As for eligibility requirements, the EULA clearly states, ""You are not entitled to use the Software unless you qualify in your jurisdiction as an academic end user (e.g., student or personal learning versions of the Software may only be used by faculty, staff members and degree-, diploma- or certificate-seeking students at qualified educational institutions)."" Since the education edition is used as a learning tool, I would assume that all of the tools and features are the same in this and the ""regular"" version, however, the EULA states ""Work product and other data created with academic or education edition versions of the Software may contain certain notices and limitations that make the data unusable outside the educational use area."" I am not a student so I would not risk my hard-earned cash on a product that I may or may not be able to register, activate and use. Also, I would not want to spend hours working on a project just to find out my completed artwork is tainted with ""certain notices and limitations that make the data unusable."" Moreover, using the education edition to make any type of profit, according to the terms of the EULA, is flat-out illegal. Simple as that. Think about it -- why would Corel price their product at $379 when anyone, student or not, could instead purchase a heavily-discounted educational edition for only $99? It doesn't make sense. To give you another example, Adobe sells Photoshop Extended CS5.5 for $999, while their educational equivalent is currently priced at $199 -- a difference of $800! Using your logic, any professional photographer (as I am), graphic artist, web designer, publishing firm, or architect could purchase the product at just 20% of its retail price and use the software in their business to turn a profit. It's ridiculous to think that Corel or Adobe would be okay with that! The terms of these companies' EULAs are very simple to understand. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, brain surgeon, or even a ""certified pc technician"" to get it."

One can also paint with a clone brush of any kind (oil, water colour, etc.) that clones from a standard gradient picture so that each brush stroke creates a gradient in itself. Painter 12 is suitable for artistic use, that is, ""hand painting"". Technical picture manipulation can be done even more effectively with other programs, such as PaintShop Pro X6.

On-line subscription learning is not for me as it expires and also requires an internet connection. I got verb modules II and III as well from this company, but I do not believe they were as well done as Level I.

Best way to check is install - if they work, great, if not - just uninstall. That's assuming you already have the programs you want to install of course, if not then cross your fingers; seriously though I think you won't have a problem as long as it is a windows program it should run.

My experience with Windows Servers in the past is that upgrading from an installed server should work, but I would image the server (back it up so you can do a full restore if necessary) and then try the upgrade. The other problem I have had with in-place upgrades is that they sometimes leave messes behind that can be difficult to sort out. When it comes to servers I have generally always done a clean install - a little more time consuming but much cleaner. Just make sure you have a good backup of everything before you start. If you have a program that can create an image of the server - even better. Good luck and let me know how it comes out."

Will this software allow me to do that?,?,"Vegas will allow you to insert chapter markers wherever you want them in the timeline. You can also custom-name them. After you edit your video project with chapter markers and all, you select a rendering template (you can also customize a template if you wish). Ideally, you should select a template (customized or not) which is compatible with Sony's DVD Architect software (also included on disc in the box). Make sure to check the box in the template which allows you to keep the chapter markers in the rendered video. Once rendered, you put the video and audio files into a folder for DVD Architect (video and audio files should be rendered separately, but in the same folder). The folder should also contain a .sfl file so your chapter markers will also carry over into DVD Architect. You then import the rendered video into DVD Architect and select to create a chapter menu. Just import the video; the audio and .sfl files will follow automatically. That is when you can create a menu system based on where you inserted chapter markers in Vegas. To speed things along, you can simply select ""make movie"" in Vegas which will automatically send the appropriate files to DVD Architect. However, I've found that taking the more complex route of selecting a rendering template and customizing it does yield a much better picture when the final DVD is burned. Selecting ""make movie,"" I've found tends to compromise picture quality on the completed DVD."

I have been using PaperPort on-and-off since it came bundled with one of my old scanners decades ago, and started using it full time when I bought an expensive all-in-one to go ""paperless"" from Konica Minolta in 2006. I purchased the standard version of v.12 directly from Nuance as it came with all of the extra pieces that made it ""better"" than just buying the pro version. That worked fine on my XP machine. The fun began when I decided to reinstall the program on a machine with Win7 this past few weeks. The software worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then, out of the blue, I got an error shutting it down on start-up. I researched this on Nuance's website and it had a fix listed for this error. However, the changes that you had to make to correct this problem were already done on the machine. I decided to give Nuance a call as I assumed it would be a quick fix they'd be able to direct me to over the phone. After being in hold-hell for an eternity, the ""tech"" that answered wanted twenty bucks to answer my question... and suggested that instead I pay to upgrade to v. 14. Ummm... Hello. I wasn't looking to be up-sold to the newest version (which, in reality I already own)... but... to get my still supported version working. I told him I was unwilling to pay twenty bucks for support (since 1) I was just installing the software; 2) the fixes on the website didn't work and 3) I could almost buy the newer release [which I already own] for almost the same money)... nor get sold a newer version as this one was supposedly still supported. He said ""Okay"" and hung up. Despite searching their knowledge base, I could never find a solution. I put in for ""eMail"" tech support, assuming I'd get a resolution, but instead got an email from the same tech I spoke to looking for $$ to answer my installation issue... and suggesting I pay to upgrade to v.14. I was pissed off. I already OWN v.14 but wanted to stick with v.12 because it's what I'm already using AND is still supported. Is it THAT difficult to understand? I reset the machine back to factory settings and tried to do a new install. Again, it worked (this time) for a few days. Having had enough, I dug through my boxes and pulled out the v.14 release. I installed it two days ago. I should note that on their ''support'' website my initial call was documented as ""resolved"" --- which to them obviously means it was resolved that I wouldn't pay them another nickel. Version 14 STANDARD is currently running without fixes. I kept the older version of their .PDF reader as the newer one that came with v.14 didn't have all of the features of the older one. I'm waiting to see whether this one continues to work or decides to crash and burn on me. I'm sure that if it does the later, they'll be looking to friction burn my credit card to resolve the issue with their bugged-out software. If that's the case, I'll be packing it up and moving over to FileCenter or some other alternative just to not have to deal with these bozo's. In my opinion, after having worked with software vendors since the first PC XT came out in 1983, these guys are in the business of selling you the latest and greatest, not supporting what they have on the street. I've NEVER had a technical support person attempt to get me to buy a paid upgrade on a still supported piece of software. I wonder if he's on commission!"

Their ""help"" helps a little bit. This website has some pretty good tutorials, although it now teaches the later versions (Creative Suite which comes after Elements 12): www.photoshopessentials.com.

If you are asking if you can install Family Tree Maker on a new computer without the original install CDs, then I think you will have to buy a new copy of FTM. Sorry."

I was using 10 but switched to Essentials 2012 because of issues with merging web info with my tree. Ancestry support told me what I was seeing was a known issue and would likely not be corrected. They suggested I upgrade because the latest version doesn't have the problem and so far it has been fine. I'm still running Essentials 2012 on my XP box because that is where my files are but I'll eventually reinstall and move everything to the Win8 machine.

It's difficult for software to recognize handwriting from a picture (after you've written) and even software that claims to be able to do it, won't do a very good job unless you already write like a computer. There are also a few technologies that use a special pen and paper and the pen records what you write on the paper and can then dump that data into a computer which can probably perform handwriting recognition. Don't know how accurate it would be though."

What you'll get in ABBY is an editable representation of that document with ABBY's best guess as to the identity of poorly or lightly printed characters. You then work through the document, page by page and line by line making any corrections that you require. After that you can save the edited document to MS Word or to your favorite word processing program for further touch-up. How much touch-up required depends on your preferences set in the word processing program and how closely those preferences match those that you chose in ABBY. The most obvious match-up you'd want to watch for is font type and point size. Margins, indents, tab spacing and line spacing settings are also important. You want the document in the word processor to look as closely as possible like the paper document you originally scanned into ABBY. This may take a little playing around to get right, but is tedious rather than difficult. For a reasonably clearly printed paper document, the accuracy of the letter-by-letter translation into the editable image will surprise you. As to headers, footers and page numbers, you can de-select those before you save the edited image to your word processing program, simply by drawing a box around the elements of the image that you want to save."

open-ended,B0065OPJ1U,"Feb 15, 2015",1423987200.0,what is the best bang for the buck webcam or camera to use with this software? need beginner camera/webcam for 12 year old.,,"Okay, so here is the deal. Dragonframe works only with certain cameras. Keeping that in mind, there are A LOT of them (the full list is here: http://www.dragonframe.com/camera.php) Regardless of what kind of camera you buy, your going to have to spend AT LEAST a couple hundred dollars. Because Dragonframe is a program used by professionals in the industry, most people who usually buy Dragonframe are also people who are working professionally. Since your boy is 12 years old, you won't have to by him a $45,000 dollar camera BUT a camera (much like a car) is an investment. So spending $100-300 realistically isn't going to probably happen. Keeping that in mind, here are some things to consider. Obviously as with most things, newer models are going to cost more. A 5D Mark ii is going to be cheaper than the Mark iii for example. I'd recommend sticking with the Canon camera or maybe the web cameras. The web camera's are really tricky because you can buy something that looks like it's going to deliver but then not. Something else to remember is that with many camera's, the lens that use is really going to impact the quality of images you take. The body's of the cameras basically set up your limitations, what it can or can't do. The lenses are adaptable because each lens works in a different way. Of course, the nicer the lens the more expensive usually. Most Canon cameras also come with the lenses when you buy them. Make sure you know your getting a lens if you buy online. Most of the other camera's on the list (the blackmagics and others) are the ""professional professional"" meaning your going to spend at least, AT LEAST $10,000 on them. I'd recommend looking into, for you - and of course this is just my opinion BUT - the Canon EOS 60D, Canon EOS 500D, and the Canon EOS Digital Rebel T3i. The T3i is sort of like the ""professional camera"" before it made it to professional (if that makes sense.) It's going to give you some pretty good range for the most part and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. If you go to an animation school and are studying stop motion animation, you use these cameras for your assignments. Something to consider? I'd really, really, REALLY strongly urge and recommend printing out the list and bringing it to a camera shop somewhere near you and talking with someone. They'll be able to give you the ultimate rundown on what they think you should do. Anyway, I hope this helped. I'm a film student so I've been exposed to all sorts of cameras and machinery relating to both film shooting and animation, so of course my opinion is going to biased but I hope this helped. Your kids are very lucky."

If you add new ingredients to the ingredient list, you also have the option of entering the corresponding Brand information but it is not required. FYI...the Brand information is used by the software to compute nutrition facts, estimate grocery shopping costs, and so forth. One of the neat things about Cook'n is that you can actually switch from one brand to another and get a different nutritional result. This makes it possible for you to ""healthify"" a recipe by simply changing brands. It's pretty powerful that way."

open-ended,B006WODYUQ,"Jul 24, 2014",1406185200.0,What level of fluency or competency can I expect after I have completed all five levels?,,"Depends what you're willing to put into it. From my own experience, I completed one to two lessons a day for a little over 60 days in advance of a language test. Keep in mind that I took Spanish in high school and two semesters in college but didn't really use it after that, so it had been over 10 years. On a six point scale where 0 indicates no knowledge, 3 is considered fluent and 5 is a native speaker, I tested at a 2 in Speaking, 2 in Listening Comprehension and 2+ in Reading. I think if you are willing to put in at least 60-90 days with this program in Spanish, you can get to a level of proficiency where you can travel comfortable in a Spanish speaking country and get yourself around as well as carry on a basic conversation. If you have some base in the language and can put in more than 90 days with this program and practice with someone who is a native speaker, you can get to fluency within 6-9 months. Hands down, there is no better language program on the market!"

However, that is a refreshing break from Word's incessant formatting and self-correcting when you don't want something rewritten, i.e. dialogue in a strange dialect or outlines. Scrivener will alert you to mispells, grammar screw-ups, et al with highlighted words and phrases, but you have to fix most of them yourself. i'm not sure about run on sentences yet. I am starting to like it better than Word, solely as a word processor. Learning curve is short, when in doubt, Google it."

open-ended,B0079KJB54,"Dec 9, 2013",1386576000.0,no of licenses,,"The short answer is: ""When you purchase a licence for Scrivener, you automatically receive what we call a ""household"" licence for the platform you selected. What we mean by this is as follows: You can install and run Scrivener on any machines you own and of which you are the predominant user. You can install and run Scrivener on any machines based predominantly in your house and used by family members living with you. This only applies to machines running the platform covered by your licence (you cannot use a Mac serial number with the Windows version or vice versa, because the Mac and Windows versions are separate development efforts)."" Go to: Literature and Latte technical support: http://www.literatureandlatte.com/support.php Scroll about half way down to ""Multiple Registrations and Activation."" After reading that, click the link in that section ""registering multiple computers"" (http://scrivener.tenderapp.com/help/kb/purchasing-and-installation/can-i-use-my-license-on-more-than-one-computer) and read the above quote and a few limitations - some of which do not make any sense to me. For example, ""If your child is living away at university then he or she will need a separate license"" and ""If you own a laptop and a desktop, your husband (or wife, or partner) owns a laptop and your daughter has a desktop in her room, and all those machines are running Windows, then you just need a single Windows license."" These seem to me to be mutually exclusive - unless the daughter is excluded from the family, i.e., husband and wife can active their copies and take their laptops where ever but the daughter can't? Or are they tracking the number of laptops activated? If tracking by IP address, I assume any activation at ""home"" would be allowed, absent multiple laptop issues. Whatever the case, it seems to me that an entire household can active separate copies without much objection - and - there are workarounds if multiple laptop activations are required. Finally, you will notice on the support page that it states, ""Note that in some rare cases, you may exceed the activation limit through normal usage. If you feel your usage of the program is within the bounds set forth in the licence agreement, or suspect that your serial number has been compromised, contact us via e-mail so we can sort out your incident and get your software installed again."" It seems to me that they are willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt should activation issues ensue. I activated a desktop and laptop without any issues.

Scrivener is divided into three sections that cannot be deleted: Draft, Research, Trash. I tend to follow the Hero's Journey scheme for fiction and I rename the Draft folder to Manuscript. I then create sub-folders named after each of the scheme's divisions, e.g. ordinary world, crossing the first threshold, test, approach to the innermost cave, etc. Within each division I create yet other sub-directories in which I create various scenes, etc., etc., etc. Given that your composition is, in part, complete you have the option of pasting as a single block or you can break it up into chapters, scenes, incomplete ideas, a chunk of dialogue here or there, or as Act 1, Act 2, Act 3 - whatever - and place each part in its respective folder. When you complete your composition, Scrivener (at your command) automatically compiles the parts into manuscript form as you have arranged them in your folders/sub-folders. The beauty of this is that, at any time, you can arrange and rearrange the various scenes or chapters by dragging them to wherever you like within your composition without copy/paste actions. But yes, you can simply copy and paste your entire composition into one folder and utilize Scrivener's outlining capability and add to it ad lib. Ed"

open-ended,B007BG9VLK,"Feb 1, 2013",1359705600.0,What is the difference between LR4 and elements 11?,,"Too many to address here. The short answer is that if you edit images one at a time and only need basic cataloguing capability, get Elements. It is very good image editor. On the other hand, if you need to be able to process, caption, keyword and catalogue large numbers of images simultaneously, get Lightroom. Lightroom handles 90% + of my processing needs, but lacks a few filters and layer features that Elements has that I find useful, so I use both. If I had to only own one, it would be Lightroom without question. Once you learn catalogue management it is a great program, and I really love that adjusted images don't have to be saved. Lightroom saves the adjustment recipe for each image, and these can be tweaked indefinitely without affecting the original image file or necessitating saving a copy of the adjusted image (this helps keep file management very clean and neat without multiple copies of images floating around). If you can only own one, best to download trial versions of both and try them before you buy. Most of the techniques you learn in one package will carry over fairly well to the other, so you won't be wasting much time if you decide against one on which you've invested time."

open-ended,B007BG9VLK,"Feb 1, 2013",1359705600.0,What is the difference between LR4 and elements 11?,,"Too many to address here. The short answer is that if you edit images one at a time and only need basic cataloguing capability, get Elements. It is very good image editor. On the other hand, if you need to be able to process, caption, keyword and catalogue large numbers of images simultaneously, get Lightroom. Lightroom handles 90% + of my processing needs, but lacks a few filters and layer features that Elements has that I find useful, so I use both. If I had to only own one, it would be Lightroom without question. Once you learn catalogue management it is a great program, and I really love that adjusted images don't have to be saved. Lightroom saves the adjustment recipe for each image, and these can be tweaked indefinitely without affecting the original image file or necessitating saving a copy of the adjusted image (this helps keep file management very clean and neat without multiple copies of images floating around). If you can only own one, best to download trial versions of both and try them before you buy. Most of the techniques you learn in one package will carry over fairly well to the other, so you won't be wasting much time if you decide against one on which you've invested time."

That said, Lightroom 5 is now in Beta testing and will be released sometime in the next very few months. I would wait for that. LR5 will contain some actions that currently have to be accomplished by going out of LR into either Photoshop, Elements, or some other program. For the price, Lightroom is so far superior to anything else I can think of that I'd certainly upgrade. Besides, you'll get a price break since you already own LR2."

The Home and Student Suite does not include many OpenType features or color management options. The Home and Student Suite does not include VBA / VSTA or Macros. The Home and Student Suite does not include PrePress, PreFlight, several of the file formats in the other versions. Note that if you are already a Paintshop Pro user, PSP cannot read the .CPT files generated by PhotoPaint and vice versa. Corel has about the best file format translators in the industry.

But what the manual does contain is a service number: telephone them and they are amazingly ""present"" and willing to walk anyone--this techno-dinosaur included--through some of the most difficult of exercises. The result is always equal to the expected high quality of the Finale line. As someone who works in ethnomusicology however, my world of sound requires a few more options--like following Glass or the Kronos Quartet-like composition, or better yet, having an extended list of instrumentation (say, for Asian instrumentation, e.g., gamellin (sp), the Korean horizontal flute, etc.). I can dream. But as I do so, do call the customer service agent for Finale. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. JAW"

I found I had to install files other than WordPerfect to make it fully functional with Dragon. (Needed to install the ""extras"" -- a file containing clip art and other things I did not think I would use, in order to make WP and Dragon work together.) Perhaps this would also be required on Windows 8 as well. I purchased a machine with Windows 8 on it and promptly set it in a corner, probably never to be used again unless I can ""reverse it"" to Windows 7."

Also, what does it have that X5 doesn't have?",,"The main differences are that Standard has Video Studio Essentials X4 and and Ebook publisher - so the real question is whether either of those programs would be helpful. For my part, the only part of the suite that I use is WordPerfect - too bad they don't sell it as a standalone any more. As far as X5 vs X6 is concerned, the major difference is that X6 allows WordPerfect to be open more than once at the same time. This means that you can use multiple monitors (available since Windows XP) and have easier access to more than one document at a time. Again, though, this isn't as great as it sounds because you can have more than one document open at a time with X5 - you just have to switch back and forth in the same screen. Bottom line...if you use X5 and you're happy with it, you won't notice any significant difference with X6."

Mics, etc?",,"There are two main ways to connect your instruments to your PC to access the software; one is to buy an audio interface; this is a very basic setup in which you can plug a guitar or instrument into the interface which then sends the data via USB to your software; you also monitor output through the interface. The second way, this is how I do it, is to buy a small mixer which has what is referred to as a ""control room"" section; this allows you to hook instruments, mics etc to the mixer, feed them into the computer through the PC's line in jack, and monitor the output without creating a feedback loop; I like it best because you don't have to worry about that awful latency problem, the delay between playing and hearing what you played... with this setup you can hook up as many instruments as there are inputs on the mixer; if you play keyboards at all, consider buying a midi controller keyboard, these usually require only a single USB cable to send the signal in and power the keyboard itself, and Mixcraft6 recognized my old midi controller without my having to reinstall the drivers, which was excellent... hope this wasn't too wordy to understand; bottom line, I think buying a mixer is your best bet; you can use headphones or hook it up to a stereo system and listen through speakers."

I find it easiest to open Windows Explorer, open the folder containing the files and drag each one into a track in the Mixcraft project where it becomes a CLIP... you can then move them around and order them as desired; eventually you will want to put all the clips in one track; if you drag a clip and overlap the clip in front of it, Mixcraft automatically creates a crossfade; drag the clip back and forth to determine how much crossfade you want... then you can use one of the Mixcraft CD burning engines to burn your mix to CD... hope this helps... remember, first you need to rip the selected tracks to your hard drive using Windows Media Player, to make them available to drag into your Mixcraft project..."

open-ended,B008EQUD4U,"Apr 24, 2015",1429858800.0,what are the benefits of Camtasia over Captivate?,,"A good review by Bill Albrecht: Captivate VS Camtasia: What's the difference? By Bill Albrecht on April 4, 2013 As an eLearning developer, I've come to know there are a number of development tools out there to serve our learning purposes. Like any job, a decision needs to be made as to which tool is best used to accomplish the task at hand. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to fix a toaster (unless it was broken beyond repair, then I'd say have at it.) In the case of eLearning, you wouldn't want to use a tool that can't accomplish the task. Two of the most often used and requested eLearning development programs out there today are Adobe Captivate and Techsmith Camtasia. Both programs offer a wide variety of tools that assist in making web-based learning more interactive, intuitive, and overall fun. At the same time, there are some differences to take into consideration when deciding which one to use developing your curriculum. Let's examine both programs and compare. ADOBE CAPTIVATE Allows the user to create interactive simulations of software programs Takes detailed screen capture simulations Allows for complex student interaction; giving them the opportunity to go down the incorrect path and learn from mistakes Complex and varied activity and testing options (multiple choice, hot-spots, drag and drop, matching) TECHSMITH CAMTASIA Takes full-motion video simulations Great for streaming video content Easy to post to file sharing sites, such as YouTube Less expensive than Captivate BOTH PROGRAMS CAN: Capture screen and keyboard info exactly as done and typed Record video and audio/voice Include SCORM/AICC complaint quizzes As you can see from the comparison, Adobe Captivate is the better choice when going for something that is more interactive. A hands-on learner would definitely prefer a program that is made through Captivate as opposed to Camtasia. The learning and testing options are far more varied when it comes to Captivate. The program is a little more costly, but for the amount of services it offers it is fairly priced. Adobe Captivate can also be purchased as part of a bundle through the Adobe eLearning Suite. Techsmith Camtasia's strong points are in price and full-length video. At first glance, Camtasia looks a little like Windows Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere combined, so the interface isn't too difficult to figure out. If you are looking to capture a full-length video of an action you would take to complete a process on the computer or system, Camtasia is probably your better bet. It is also very handy for live streaming video."

I cannot find any information what plugin?,,"The quick answer I would offer is to install the VLC video player software. (search the internet for vlc or videolan.org) It is free and contains many plugins or codecs Windows needs to play different video file formats. However, your professor may be using proprietary software so step one should be to check with your professor and/or the school's IT department to see if there is any special software you need to install. If they are of no help then VLC is your best bet."
open-ended,B008EQUD4U,"Mar 4, 2014",1393920000.0,compare with premiere pro cc ?,,"I have both Camtasia 8 and Adobe Premiere Pro. Camtasia is much easier to learn and quicker for a beginner to produce a pretty neat video! But that is because Premiere Pro is a much more powerful program, with a huge range of editing tools, especially if you use it in conjunction with After Effects. It can open any video file format I've ever tried to use with it. My major beef with Camtasia, is that it will not open AVCHD, MTS format video; which is the most common video format that most HD camcorders use. Some will save in mp4 (which Camtasia can open) but they are usually not in HD. My Sony Handycam would not save mp4 in full HD. And Camtasia would not open the Sony or my JVC video files without converting them first in another 3rd party program, which was a pain, and always resulted in a reduced quality video. The only acceptable solution that I have found for this problem, was to buy a Canon Vixia R40 which saves in full HD in mp4 format. I wish I had just invested the time to learn Premiere Pro right from the start, because then I would not be facing this dilemma about file format. Premiere Pro definitely has a bigger learning curve. There are tons of online instructional videos on how to use both programs. The Premiere videos on Lynda.com are really thorough but difficult to follow. I'm fairly tech-savy but I feel overwhelmed when I watch them. It usually scares me off, and I go back to Camtasia, which I am comfortable with. You might try Adobe Premiere (which is a more consumer version of Premiere Pro). You can get it in a bundle (approx $100) with Adobe Elements (A consumer version of Photoshop). I bought that about the same time as Camtasia, thinking Camtasia was just screen capture software. I liked it when I first started using it, a big improvement over Windows Movie Maker. But I didn't use it long, before Camtasia became my favorite for any video editing. (At that time, I was able to open my .mod files by just changing the extension to .avi but my upgrade to Cam8 removed that capability!) One good thing about Premiere & Premiere Elements is that the workspace and tools are similar to their full professional software; so when you do make the step up to CC, you will already be familiar with the workspace, icons, and tools in Adobe products. The other good thing is that both Adobe Premiere and Premiere Pro can open any type of video file format. Hope that was helpful, and not TMI!"

If you want the same duration for each slide to show and the same type and length of transitions - it can do it all nearly instantaneously. If you want slides to be showing for different lengths of time, there's a bit more manual work involved. But in either case, you'd render out to a video format - for the web probably .mp4. However, if you're referring to a manual slide show on a website - where the viewer can move through the slides at their own pace, that's something entirely different and is done with a plugin (slider) and individual still images on the website itself, not done in a video editing program."

I assume that you are asking about the comparison between CorelDraw in general and CS6, right? Not between the Student Suites and CS6? Basically, the design logic behind these two programs are very different, on purpose, of course. If you are used to one, it's hard to get used to the other one. It's just like Apple vs. Microsoft. Personally, I think I am more of an expert of Corel than of Adobe Photoshop. I know that Corel can do many easy tricks that are sometimes more complicated to achieve in Photoshop. I can do most of the things that Photoshop can do with Corel, but I am not expert enough to find something in Photoshop that I CAN'T do with Corel. There must be some, but I just don't know yet. Also, I think Corel is easier to use and you can create something similar with fewer and simpler steps in Corel, compared with Photoshop. But like I said earlier, this is a very personal perspective and experience-based. However, considering the prices between these two programs, if you are not a career graphic designer, and I would definitely recommend CorelDraw. On the contrary, if you think you will want to work in a graphic design company, Photoshop is the one to go. It also seems that Photoshop has a bigger support community which is either Adobe based, or supported by Adobe. If you'd like to know more about any specific areas, please do specify and let me know.

As for animation; I'm not sure if your looking for animated gif's or actually video animation. I would recommend that you download the 30 Day Trial of PaintShop Pro X5 from Corel http://www.corel.com/corel/product/index.jsp?pid=prod4900069&cid=catalog20038&segid=8100006&storeKey=us and see if it is what you are looking for. If your looking at actual video creation there are quite a few programs on the market. I have used both: Windows Movie Maker (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview) and Pinnacle Studio (http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/) Windows Movie Maker should already be on your computer if your running Windows Vista, 7, or 8. Pinnacle Studio I haven't purchased the newest version mine is a few years old and works great if your creating a large movie with hundreds of pictures. If your on a MAC then iLife/iMovie - http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/ (I haven't used it but hear that it works great) Hope that helps you out.

When you first start, it goes through some exercises so that the software recognizes your style of conversation and any accent you have. That makes it very intuitive when you start talking and dictating. It does perform punctuation and grammar when you instruct it. So if you haven't done that before, you will need to get used to that. You will say things like ... Quote, comma, period, end quote. But another user mentioned that it doen't help with that, and I believe he or she means that if you don't know correct punctuation or grammar, it won't edit for you. Also, you can train it to know how to spell things like names that are different. On my iPad, I can't get it to ever spell my name right, but Dragon will learn and then do it correctly from that point on. You can even learn instructions for going back a few words and tell it to capitalize or delete or add something. It does take time to learn these things, but it is well worth the investment, especially if you don't type fast or need to stand. I think a person could also purchase a Bluetooth if they wanted to be doing something at the same time! But I haven't tried that yet. Best wishes to you as you write your book!"

Maybe you may find a deal on a used version for Mac at Amazon. I bought mine used for about half the price of the new software simply because the box seal was broken.

It's pretty easy. When you load the software, it'll ask how you want to do the transfer. Select ""Network"". Load the software on both computers (I think they want you to load the ""new"" computer first, but the instructions will talk you through that) and follow the rest of the instructions. If you can't get both of the computers on the same network, then you'll need a USB transfer cable OR you'll have to connect both ""hard drives"" to the same computer (I'm a technician, so that's easy for me to do...

The answer to your question is a little tricky. IF you can connect BOTH computers to the same network (e.g. in your home or office), either by wire OR by wireless (or even a combination), then PC Mover can do the entire transfer over the network. It's pretty easy. When you load the software, it'll ask how you want to do the transfer. Select ""Network"". Load the software on both computers (I think they want you to load the ""new"" computer first, but the instructions will talk you through that) and follow the rest of the instructions. If you can't get both of the computers on the same network, then you'll need a USB transfer cable OR you'll have to connect both ""hard drives"" to the same computer (I'm a technician, so that's easy for me to do... Most people wouldn't go that route). I hope that helps. If you need more assistance, feel free to write."

PCmover will move all of your software like Office and Quicken to your new PC. Your software will be fully functional in the destination PC. The new PC will be a carbon copy of the old one. I have done this several times and I'm still impressed how PCmover copies everything to a new PC. I hope this is the answer to your question. You can also call Laplink support to get more answers. They are very helpful when you call.

I assume this. One key applies to the package you are purchasing...that is, the same key for the three machines, etc. They have a new downloadable version for the Windows 8 and 8.1 environment that works very well, and when the 8.1 environment is released in October, they will be up to speed with that release as well.

Availability in the US is limited, some certified Dragon dealers such as ourselves would be able to obtain it (expect delays of several weeks) but you may be better off finding a European dealer. The German version includes English. Decide whether you need Premium or Professional based on feature comparisons available for the English editions as these differences are essentially the same in the German editions."
yes/no,B008NP76AQ,"Jul 14, 2014",1405321200.0,does it do excel,N,Dragon works extraordinarily well with Excel. With text entry and with numerical entry Dragon NaturallySpeaking has surpassed 99% accuracy for my use. The one quibble I do have with it is that I've yet be able to successfully remap all the keys from the number pad to other hotkeys in order to not interfere with numerical data entry in Excel. The other small quibble is that auto complete in Microsoft Excel 2010 does not work smoothly with Dragon. This can lead to repetitive data entries which are similar but not quite identical which leads to the need to make manual corrections in your data sets in order for pivot tables and data comparison to work smoothly.

I can tell you that you can set up two profiles within it, one Spanish and one English, and use the program either way. Once you have trained the program to your voice and way of speaking, it is very accurate. About the only thing that will make the program lose accuracy is when there are other noises in the room. If you have a good microphone and a quiet environment, the program is almost perfect, and making corrections is easy too. Be sure that you have enough memory in RAM, and that you have enough hard disc space available too. These files can get pretty big, and if you are running low on either memory, the program will begin to do strange things.

yes/no,B008NP76FQ,"Jan 1, 2013",1357027200.0,Will Dragon transcribe my sermon mp3's into OpenOffice text documents?,?,"Yes and no. When using Dragon the speaker must speak in a way that will allow the Dragon software to accurately copy the dialogue. When preaching a sermon you do not say ""period"" ""comma"" ""next paragraph"" ""exclamation"" and such. Therefore, even though your words will be copied to text it may take you longer to edit your document then to just transcribe it. If you use Greek and Hebrew words they will probably not transcribe unless you teach your software these words first. Plus when you speak into Dragon it must be steady and clear. Usually preaching is not that way unless talk like Alexander Scourby reads. This of course is up to you. Of course you could just read the Bible aloud and your text would already be in print."

I don't have an iPad - I can say don't pay too much for this awful soft and you won't be too disappointed. It is virtually unusable for me. I speak reasonably coherently and intelligibly as far as I know...but this soft does not do what it says and has too many errors to be usable as a viable business aid. Perhaps in another 15 years they might get it right. I look on my perpetually hopeful purchases over the years as contributions to their research program as they seem to be the only ones out there trying to crack this very obvious nut.

It's about a $100 more if I recall correctly, which quite honestly, is difficult to do with all the disturbing and extremely costly add-ons, fees, upgrades, additions, support, services, etc., which QBs perpetually assesses for the seemingly minor details and pompous efforts they provide to assist their patrons with their product. Apparently, this process is quite intentionally designed to limit service, comprehensive accessibility and ease of use to the consumer, while incurring greater costs as he/she becomes aware of the ""bait and hook."" And rather exorbitantly at that. Tread with caution. You will likely pay in excess of $600/yr to utilize this program effectively. Everything with QBs, which I believe ought to be simply included with the program, comes at an additional, and very unwelcome fee. Trust me. Look into the other free, online programs which provide a very similar service, without all the hype, unnecessary control and expensive fees for your small business. Essentially, QBs has got me very tightly wrapped around their little greedy fingers. The software itself is alright, but they design (and are constantly redesigning) it to be much more complicated than warranted in an obvious attempt to offer you support at a significant drain to your small business resources. If you're loaded, go for it. If not, I highly recommend you look elsewhere."

QB Accountant gives you access to all of the Premier versions which include templates and reports for several kinds of industries. If you are doing bookkeeping for more than one type of business, Accountant is the way to go. In addition, the batch processing and the journal entry process make it much easier for those who know accounting to use the program.

QuickBooks Pro is usually all people need if your company is small and you aren't a bookkeeper or accountant with several clients/companies that you are doing the bookkeeping for.

First, although 2013 Quicken Deluxe eliminated that frustrating ""rolling"" year feature (allowing you to actually create a January-December 2013 budget), the new module doesn't actually ""duplicate"" an existing budget. So when I attempted to duplicate my 2012 budget to create a 2013 budget, what I got didn't capture, for example, carefully planned month-to-month expenditures - like utility payments that are higher in winter than summer, boat work that occurs only in October (winterizing) and May (de-winterizing), etc. Many categories were simply zero. Or they were different than the prior budget. You can't put in an annual amount and have the program average that. Instead you have to manually calculate the average and tell the program to use that average for January and then to do the same for all the remaining months of the year. There are also glitches with categories and sub-categories, and that seems to flow through to reports, which sometimes drop categories which you've selected and sometimes add the category's total to the total of the sub-categories so that the total is wildly inflated. And often when you attempt to correct that, the budget drops back to using the existing year (2012) instead of the year you have specified (2013). Also, none of my existing reports for 2012 or earlier years came up correctly. They all came up with all categories (about 300) selected instead of ones I had selected for that report (about 50). I have used Quicken for many years and haven't liked how they changed the budget module a couple years back. But this one is really bad, and I'm wondering what to do if these major problems aren't corrected. I'm hoping that my many years of budgeting data hasn't been corrupted. And I'm wondering if Intuit has any plans to really correct this product or if some decision has been made to abandon it. I notice that mobile and cloud are big issues (apparently they're also having problems), and perhaps the big picture is that companies like Intuit or Microsoft are quietly exiting the PC field for products like Quicken or Outlook that reside on the PC. Maybe I need to be looking for a web based product like Intuit's Mint.com, and perhaps that's where they will really be putting their resources. Obviously, Intuit hasn't yet put their first team on Quicken Deluxe 2013."

open-ended,B008RA5DIE,"Nov 7, 2014",1415347200.0,how do you use quickbooks to track donors for a church,,"If you receive cash, check, or credit card donations from donors or members, you can enter these revenues as donations in QuickBooks. Use the donation (sales receipt) form instead of merely entering a deposit; you can then track your donations by type, program, or source. As a result, when you use the donation form instead of deposits, your Biggest Donors/Grants report will include the donations. In addition, other sales and item reports are available. To do this task Go to the Nonprofit menu and click Enter Donations (Sales Receipts). Click the Customer:Job drop-down arrow and choose the donor/grant. Click Add New if the donor/grant is not listed, and add the donor (customer) or grant (job) to QuickBooks. In the Item column, choose an item that corresponds to the type of donation. You can select one of the options in the Item List or you can add a new item to use for the donation. To set up a new item, go to the Lists menu and click Item List. Click Item at the bottom of the list and click New. Click the Type drop-down list and choose Service. Click the Account drop-down list and choose the corresponding account. Choose a name that matches the corresponding account; for example, a Donation item associated with the Grants income account. In the Class column, select the appropriate fund or project or add a new class to track the donation to a new fund or project. Enter the amount of the donation that is being applied to the fund or project (class), as specified by the donor. (Optional) Click Customize to customize the donation form. If you plan to print the donation form and give it to the donor as a receipt, consider customizing it to add a personalized donor message to the form. To do so, click the Donor Message button and click Add New. Verify that all information on the form is correct. (Optional) Click Print to print a copy of the donation. If Deposit To appears at the bottom of the form, click the Deposit To drop-down list and choose the checking account to which you want to make the deposit. Note: QuickBooks processes Donations in the same way that it processes Sales Receipts. If your Sales & Customers preferences are set to ""Use Undeposited Funds as a default deposit to account,"" you will not see Deposit To on the form, and your donation checks will automatically be added to your Undeposited Funds account. In this case, remember to create a Deposit transaction to move funds from the Undeposited Funds account into your checking account. Click Save & Close or click Save & New.

yes/no,B008RA5DIE,"Jul 18, 2013",1374130800.0,Does this version include payroll,?,"Yes and no. There is an employee section that will record hours and calculate pay. However, in order to use the full payroll function you must either track everything manually (what a pain) that means checking tax tables each and every time you cut a payroll check because all the tax deductions are set at zero. You have to really know your stuff. Otherwise you have to subscribe to QuickBooks Payroll Function which is an additional charge. As I mentioned, Intuit wants your money. You can get QuickBooks bundled with Intuit Enhanced Payroll through Amazon for about $100 more but be aware that enhanced payroll only handles up to 3 employees, then you pay extra for more. You can also pay Intuit monthly for the Payroll service. I don't know, but I imagine they make you upgrade yearly because of the new tax codes. Just my guess. Hope this helps."

I dread the ordeal, but I will probably try to get them on the phone and try to get some commitment to fix some of the most glaring issues associated with entering Statement Charges. Having been in the industry for three decades, having released scores of hardware, software, and systems products, I am appalled that Intuit would put out such trash. Really, it's just accounting software. Long ago they had built the necessary feature set. The only reason to continue releasing new versions is to create a revenue stream. In a rational world, people would be induced to buy the new version because it contained features they wanted. That's not the case with Quickbooks. Intuit forces people to the new version by killing off features in the old version that people can't live without. There is NO technical reason why Intuit should maintain control over their customers use of the on-line banking functionality. It should just be embedded in the product. They designed it to work through their servers precisely so they could cut off access and force people to their new product. I actually don't mind paying them the money. What I really resent is that they don't have the integrity nor concern for their customers to make sure the product works before they force us to buy it. So, they put me through all kinds of hell trying to manage workarounds for their bugs and having to check and double check to make sure the information is recorded correctly. Just so they can squeeze a couple of hundred dollars out of me. That mentality offends and disgusts me."

open-ended,B008RA5AWS,"Jan 23, 2013",1358928000.0,What is the annual fee for the payroll for three or more?,,"Extra $100 for 4+ employees. I just called. It's a bit of a hassle if you already have a payroll subscription, like I do. First you have to cxl your current subscription, then install the payroll disc and then call and they charge you the full whack ($429) for enhanced payroll, then credit back the value they assign to the enhanced payroll of 3 or fewer employees ($329). SO, if you get the enhanced payroll for less than $329 off the shelf (i.e. Costco or Amazon), then you decide if it's worth the hassle. From everything I've read, the 2013 QB Pro is not something to be super excited about, and may even boggle your brain due to poorer visual interface, new report menu format, etc. I'm thinking about getting the Value pack and if I can do the payroll only, and without simultaneously upgrading the QB Pro, then that's what I'll do for now."

You may be able to purchase the MSDN subscription seperately, but you may get a good deal by purchasing the MSDN subscription with Visual Studio.

Please advise.,,"There are many software programs that allow you to paint or draw on a computer. In these programs you first create a surface to work on. This usually consists of a blank white area. To draw or paint you would then click on a tool option such as a brush or pencil, select a color, and then click and drag your the cursor over the top of the canvas. You can draw with a mouse--but it is awkward for many reasons. Most people buy a digital tablet which comes with a pen (stylus) that controls the cursor on their computer. With a stylus you have many more options on how the strokes are made and it is much easier to draw with because you hold the stylus like you would a regular pen. Some people, like myself, have a pressure sensitive laptop that comes with a stylus. This enables me to use the stylus directly on the monitor of my laptop. I can adjust settings so that if I push harder on the stylus my brush stroke gets darker, or wider, or both. That is something you cannot do with a mouse. To change the line thickness with a mouse you have to go to the brush size and change it. Digital painting is a very big area right now. It is amazing what some people can create. I hope this helps."

If I install this on my current computer and get a new computer down the road will I have to re-purchase?,,"No, you shouldn't have an issue. In general, once you purchase software that requires you to enter a ""key or validation code"" during installation, such as SP6, you can install it on any computer you want. After all, you own it, and Autodesk (as well as most software manufacturers) realizes people buy new computers. You generally run into installation limitations when you purchase software for business use or buy network licenses."

The MT2S file type is primarily associated with 'AVCHD'. AVCHD is a high-definition digital video format that supports 1080i and 720p with a reasonably small file size. AVCHD files are based on the MPEG4 CODEC. AVCHD video files can be burned to Blu-ray discs and played in compatible devices, such as Blu-ray disc players and the Sony PlayStation3. Various video programs can edit or convert this file format which is generally used by Sony and some Panasonic video cameras.

I assume that it was of the same demensions as the screen I received with Pinnacle 14 about 6ft x 6ft. Agter a lot of reading on green screen an experimenation I have found that larger screens are needed along with good lighting. Look on Amazon for green screens and you will find some good set-ups. The screen you will receive will work for simple projects. George

Actually, if you go to the McAfee website, you can do a comparison there. But, these are the add'l. things: 1)Encrypt sensitive documents-even photos-in a password-protected vault on your PC to keep your identity safe from hacking as well as theft or loss of your PC. 2)Easily and safely shorten and share website links to Facebook, Twitter, or email. 3) Advanced SiteAdvisor LIVE software checks and alerts you to risky websites you receive in social media, email, and instant messages and blocks online phishing attempts to steal your personal and confidential information. Those are the 3 things. However, in my opinion, Internet Security pretty much has those things (like SiteAdvisor) and again, in my opinion, they overlap w/the 3 additions that are in Total Protection."
open-ended,B008V4S1GC,"Apr 3, 2013",1364972400.0,How long is the subscription for updates? 1 year?,,It's just a one year subscription. It starts counting down the day it's installed. About a week before it expires your computer will pop up a message that it's about to expire and you can immediately renew online but the online prices are usually $20 more than what you can buy the disc for on Amazon.

yes/no,B008V4S1GC,"Jul 28, 2013",1374994800.0,does this product automaticly put in ID and password for you,N,"No. You don't use an ID and Password to access your McAfee Internet Security software. If you mean does it automatically sign you in to other websites, etc., the answer is also no, which is a good thing. However, the install is VERY easy and once you're a user of it, when you buy a new version next year and install it, it will automatically uninstall any traces of the older version(s).

But I do know it has very respectable formatting abilities, nice assortment of fonts and sizes, plus a lot more other amenities I just didn't expect from a free program; there are spreadsheets, point-whatchamacallit templates, even some for making up flyers, business cards and other things. There's links to go to to get even more templates, but though they looked very interesting, I didn't have much need for them, a lot of them had to do with other languages and those techno-functions that are far beyond my ken. It's quite easy to use, also. I like Scrivener, once I got used to it, but you practically need an engineering degree to figure out how to use the damn thing. Hope that helps!"

I'm sure they will eventually produce another version and probably in several different editions, but I don't see the next version of a software that's been around for more than a decade suddenly making a quantum-leap in performance.

Dragon virtually none! Save a couple hundred bucks with less frustration."

Although I haven't looked at it in a while and it may have changed with the last update, the Mac dictation is far more limited and is more appropriate for a sentence or two or quick commands. Unless it has radically changed, it is not as accurate as Dragon, once you have set up and implemented Dragon. It is good for a quick sentence here or there but isn't yet set up for dictating long text documents the way that Dragon is. I agree it would be much better to have all this at your fingertips within the OS itself (and I'd even be willing to pay for an add on). Dragon definitely could use some competition in this market and Apple clearly has the ability to do this, as does Google. Sadly, neither company has released anything that can compete directly with Dragon. Dragon's software definitely works, but whether you are using it in Windows or OS X, it is definitely quirky and never completely integrates with the host OS. Having the most mature and viable product and pretty much the ONLY product for individual use, has allowed Dragon to charge higher prices, give so-so customer support to retail consumers, and continue to put a product that never quite meshes completely with the host OS (although it remains highly useful and is gobs faster than typing). It is only a matter of time, though, and this is a field where some healthy competition would be a good thing."

The windows version sold by Nuance is called Dragon Naturally Speaking and that one does recognize Spanish with the correct language pack. It is also a much better program. For people with a mac, the only solution would be to infall windows with VMWare Fusion or Parallels, and then Dragon Naturally Speaking. That would give you Spanish language recognition for dictation in a mac. Of course, this is not the most practical approach, but so far the only approach I am aware of that works."

open-ended,B0094KBQL4,"Feb 13, 2014",1392278400.0,What is the difference with Adobe CS6 Master Collection [LEGACY VERSION] ??,,"Adobe has moved to a subscription model- you pay a certain amount every month and you have access to the newest version of their Creative Suite. CS6 was the last to be released on a disc. Personally, I wanted a disc so I would own the program and not have to pay a monthly fee, so I got CS6- works for me. I just didn't want to have projects that I cannot open because I did not pay a subscription that month. The life of a freelancer is variable and some months are good and some are slow- I wouldn't want to be in a position where I am in a slow month and am offered work I can't do because I can't afford the monthly fee. It isn't a lot but- kind of the principle of the thing. If I have a file on my computer- art I have created- I want to be able to have a functional program that will open it up. Otherwise it feels like my art is held hostage. So, it is called Legacy because it is not the newest version which is not on disc."

Is this System Builder license locked to a single PC (i.e. motherboard) or can be activated on another PC configuration after upgrade?,,"Windows 8 can be transferred to new hardware; it just needs to be re-activated. Here's my recent experience... I did a clean install of Windows 8 64-bit System Builder on a dated computer. Everything worked great- I was happy. I then successfully activated Windows 8. About a month later I decided that I wanted to build an almost entirely new system. I bought a new mainboard, processor & memory combination. I then took my original hard drive with Windows 8 already installed & activated on it, and I connected it to the newer components I assembled. Everything worked great- I was happy. Except Windows 8 needed to be re-activated. I tried re-activating by Internet and was instructed onscreen to activate by phone instead. I called the phone number displayed and was immediately connected to an automated telephone system. The automated voice asked me to read aloud 5 or 6 sets of numbers which were on my screen, or I could use the phone keypad to enter in the same information. I elected to read the sets of numbers aloud, and Microsoft's automated system accepted this information without any problems. I believe it was at this time that the automated voice asked me how many computers I had installed this on. I said ""one"" and the automated system affirmed that answer. The system then said it would give me 5 or 6 sets of brand new numbers which I would need to type into my system. This is all done on the same screen within Windows 8 on which I had originally tried to re-activate. The automated voice stated the numbers clearly and I typed them into their respective entries onscreen. The voice then affirmed that Windows 8 was now activated. That's it! In this situation, I didn't need to speak with an actual person, but some situations may require speaking directly to a Microsoft Customer Service Rep. I'm not certain how many times this procedure can be easily repeated. I'm thinking about switching to a solid state drive in the near future. I'm guessing I might need to re-activate Windows 8 again when I do. I hope this helps!"

yes/no,B009716H7S,"Oct 17, 2014",1413529200.0,Can you separate audio from video?,Y,"Hi Mike, I've never had a reason to do that so your question made me curious so I tried it out. Power Director has a series of ""tracks"" that it displays when you edit a video. The original video has both a video and audio track. There are additional tracks below those that allow you to add another video and audio track, add an effects trqck, etc etc. All of the tracks also have a small control at the head of the track that allows you to turn them on and off at will. So, I opened an unedited video and just clicked ""disable"" at the head of the origianl audio track and the audio is gone. Click in the disable audio track again and your video is back. Power Director keeps all of the original material (original video, audio) additonal audio or video, additional effects, etc active within a ""project"" so that you can go back later and tweak anything you'd like without having to start over. When you ""produce"" a video you edited, the produced video gives you only what you enabled and/or added and none of the elements that you didn't want. So, you can disable the original audio, and replace it with what you want (if in fact you want audio). The produced video will have what you replace the original audio with. However, your ""project"" is always intact should you want to go back and change something later. It took me a while to get used to Power Director, but I've come to like the way it works."
open-ended,B009716H7S,"Dec 31, 2013",1388476800.0,What can I do to speed up burning and rendering time. It is taking over 12 hours to burn a 1Hr 10min DVD and it's at 86% finished?,,"Rendering video is a very CPU-intensive process and requires a pretty high-end computer, depending on the scale of the project. To lessen the rendering time, make sure you close out all other applications and processes on your computer (CTRL-ALT-DEL and tab over to ""Processes"" to find some background stuff that doesn't need to be running, like Java applets or Apple helpers). Leave your computer idle and do not attempt to use another program while video is rendering. You can also lower the file size of the video by decreasing its resolution. If none of the above make significant changes, you may just need a better computer."

yes/no,B009716H7S,"Dec 31, 2012",1356940800.0,I have three computers. Can I install it on at least two of them without having to buy another package?,?,"I don't think so. You have to go online to register the software within 30 days. If you don't, it loses some or all of its functionality (I'm ashamed to say I haven't done so yet, even though it's been longer than that since I installed it). Anyway, I suspect that once you register it on one computer, you probably won't be able to do so again for another one. Hope this helps."

According to the specifications on page 3 of the ""Cyberlink Power Director Users Guide"" that is resolution greater than 1920 x 1080. I can't verify that it works satisfactory as I have not tried it. My problem was getting 3d to work. It is only this week I have managed to cure the problems I had. It was caused by one tiny section on a hard drive having Fat 12. This did not show up as a partition on the hard drive so I never knew about it until I tried to completely reformat it using Partition Magic and it wouldn't do it. The point I am trying to make is that the more you ask of the program the more spot on the computer needs to be. The hard drive I had the problem with was only used for storing video, not for running the Windows operating system. I wish you luck in whatever route you decide to go with your video editing. Nick."

I doubt that you or anyone would be using these programs as I built them myself. I would say it is the best of all security programs. I do not use any of these because of how I use my computer.

I believe the only case where the Basic version would not print the federal return is if you use the online version, and don't pay the 20 bucks when you want to file your return. I have used the Basic version of TurboTax since 1996. In my opinion, the only benefit to the Deluxe and Premier versions is that they provide you with more guidance for more complicated returns. If you generally know what you are doing (say, not much has changed from previous tax returns), the Basic version should suit your needs."

If, however, whether you are or are not of retirement age when you took the distribution, I do not know how you should account for the withdrawal. I am pretty sure that the manager of the 401K plan will (must) provide you with a form 1099R to show that you took a distribution.

open-ended,B009CCVMO0,"Jan 4, 2013",1357286400.0,Can I download TurboTax 2012 Premier to two computers? Our desktop and our laptop?,,"The information I am conveying here is based on my understanding of the license; it's not Legal Advice. I use the CD version; not the downloaded version. I do not know the answer to your question regarding the downloaded version, but there are other reasons beyond multi-device questions why you may prefer the CD anyway, so let me at least point that out. An important capability present in the CD version and ABSENT in the downloaded version is the ability to IMPORT data from brokerages, banks, and Quicken (if you use Quicken). With the CD version, as long as you have the Quicken files for the current tax year on the same computer as the TurboTax (TT) program, you will be able to use the TT Import feature to bring in all that data instead of using hand input. Now, back to the topic of muti pc use (for the CD version). I believe this is a SINGLE USER license that you can legally install on as many PCs as you like. I use three different pc's at my home to operate Quicken and TT products because I can't always have any one of them exclusively available to me at any given time for the hours it may take to do the necessary work. So, YES, I've installed both Quicken and TT Premier (from the CD) on all three pc's with no difficulty. You will want to ""register"" each installation so that whichever pc is being used you will have full access to updates and data download features included in the product. Not so incidentally, when you use more than one pc to access your files (either with Quicken or TT) an important consideration is being assured you are accessing the most-recent file(s) from each product. The easiest way to do this, in my opinion, is to store the data files that you plan to work with ""in the cloud"" using any one of the many file storage services now available. I happen to use SugarSync, which has an incredibly handy tool called ""magic briefcase"" that automatically synchronizes the files to all the PCs no matter which pc you last may have used. When you install SugarSync on each of your pcs (via download) it will create the ""magic briefcase"" folder as a new folder in MyDocuments on each pc. Every file you store in that Magic Briefcase folder will automatically be accessible to every PC running SugarSync. At the end of your FIRST SESSION you begin using this feature by saving both Quicken and TT data files to the Magic Briefcase folder on any PC from which you first start using the product. Now, make sure you are still connected to SugarSync and as soon as you save a file to that's pc's Magic Briefcase, SugarSync will start to UPLOAD if from the PC you're working on to The Cloud. (This happens in the background as long as you stay connected to the web with SugarSync running.) Be sure you don't turn off the PC until all the files are uploaded to the Cloud if you want to be sure the next time you pull a file from SugarSync's Magic Briefcase, it's the most recent version of that file. SugarSync warns you if the file hasn't been fully uploaded. If you stop it from uploading, it will resume automatically next time you start SugarSync. So let's assume you use PC#1 and save the files to Magic Briefcase. We'll also assume you allowed SugarSync to finish its prior upload to the Cloud. Then next time you want to work, lets assume you won't be using the same pc, though you could of course. Instead you use PC#3 (which already has SugarSync installed as well). You must first make sure SugarSync is running on PC#3. As soon as you turn it on and connect SugarSync, all files previously uploaded to your MagicBriefcase will automatically be pulled in from the Cloud and downloaded to your PC#3. Wait for that download to be completed. You then simply go to the Magic Briefcase folder on PC#3 and double click the file (Qkn or TT, whichever you want to use) and it will open on PC#3. (This is why you must install the Application [TT and Qkn on all the pcs you will be using.]) When you finish your work, that most recently updated file will automatically be UPLOADED from your local Magic Briefcase folder to the Cloud Magic Briefcase folder. From then on, all you have to do is keep on using Magic Briefcase on any of your PCs that run SugarSync to open the TT or Qkn files and you will be assured you have the most recent version of the file. (The backup's are also created on Magic Briefcase if you so instruct, which is a good idea.) Let me know if you need more help or specific information on how to get SugarSync."

The windows recovery disk did help, however it erases the drivers or software for your dvd drive and your sound and printer and all your other software like word, etc. The cd will work while the dvd portion doesn't. You will also need to buy a windows xp drivers disk which you can buy on ebay for about $10 in or to get your sound and dvd to work. Assuming you get your computer to work and it should, then you need to reinstall all your other programs including printer software. Best of luck, Elliott"

Have already removed the 2010 trial version and have to see if I can reinstall it to use up what's left of the 60 day trial. If it works, will amend my review of the product accordingly. UPDATE 5/17: Reinstalled the trial version with 21 days left. You CAN import (via GPX) a ROUTE ONLY from an earlier version that supports exporting to a GPX file. All that is transferred are the origination point, stops that are shown and the destination that are part of the original .est Route Planner screen. You have to recalculate the route. The names you gave those points in Route Planner transfer, too. However, ALL OTHER PUSHPINS and associated information that you may have entered for scenic points, landmarks, that are not included in the original Route DO NOT transfer.

(click and drag them instead of having to search of the pitch change tool). The only ups I've found with Finale vs Notion is thta Finale gives you more options with notation appearances. You can place things exacty where YOU want like crescendos, text, pedal markings, dynamics. notion also lets you do this, but it has this kind of auto correct placement thing where it snaps the dynamic cyou pick under the beat you placed it on. this is still pretty accurate and you can still move thingsaround but a little less. I personally prefer Notion - it's altogether more convenient and satisfying in my opinion. :)"

Let me explain in more detail. Access your BIOS and make sure boot priority is set to the DVD drive first. That being verified, restart the computer. It will launch the DVD before Windows 7and come up with the Mint14 options screen. The first option ""Boot From Hard Drive"" will work only if you have already used Gparted Partition Manager and placed a Linux partition on your hard drive yourself. It takes a while. Trust me. You cannot forget that. The other options are for 32 bit and 64 bit processors. You must know this before you start if you have a laptop, because the computer could freeze with the battery power on. Hold the power button to turn it off. If this doesn't work you would have to unplug the batter charger and then remove the battery with the laptop on (very undesirable.) For Desktop computers just pull the plug. If the monitor for your computer does not look just perfect in ""Cinnamon"" then reboot and select ""Mate."" In very rare instances of hardware probing on startup, the audio hardware may be set to a default setting which gives you no sound output. Take you mouse and click on menu, slide the pointer to ""Control Center"" and then slide the pointer far down to click on ""Sound."" When the sound window comes up Click the mouse cursor on the ""Hardware"" Tab. In the hardware screen just select different sound hardware detected and then select the ""Test"" speaker buttons. It remembers which hardware you chose last. That should get you up and running in the most difficult and unpredictable situations."

As far as I personally know, the only differences between the two are cost and type of license - I do not believe there is any actual difference in the software itself - it is just a matter of whether or not you intend to use it for ""personal"" or ""commercial"" purposes. Be aware that Video Suite 12 was just released and is available at introductory prices. Not sure how this will impact pricing on v11 or if v11 will still be available for much longer. Again, I suggest you look at the product matrix comparison charts on the Movavi website for detail about what each product offers (ie; the various programs which collectively make up the video suite). Unless you need ONLY the specific functions of one product within the suite (which are all available separately), you'll save money and be better off buying the suite."

If you do find yourself with a non-genuine version of Windows after performing a hardware upgrade, replacing a failing component, or - in an extreme worst case scenario - upgrading a hardware driver or firmware that causes Windows to think you're using a new component, you'll need to activate Windows again with Microsoft. To re-activate a Windows 7 PC, you'll need to open the Windows Activation tool. To do so, click the Start button, type ""Activate"" into the Start menu, and click the Windows Activation shortcut. Select the ""Show me other ways to activate"" option and go through the wizard, selecting the ""Use the automated phone system"" option. You'll then be given a toll-free number you can dial. If everything goes properly, you'll be given a confirmation ID you can enter into the Windows Activation tool to make Windows genuine again. If the automated system fails, you'll be put on the line with a Microsoft customer service representative. Explain your situation and they'll hopefully allow you to re-active your installed copy of Windows, making it genuine again"

Can I install it on my work laptop with one email and then my home computer with a different user?,,"Yes! The first purchase of this item will force you to get a Microsoft account (you can use an existing @outlook.com, @live.com, or @live.com, and some will be able to employ @msn.com, etc) or you will have to create one if you want a separate account. You will then be able to select a domain, that service will use for referencing itself, as well as for use with those who do no have a custom domain. It will be in the following syntax: user@selectedsubnet.onmicrosoft.com and SharePoint will run a public website from https://selectedsubnet-public.sharepoint.com. Once the account you will use to administer the service is created, that user, in this case the adminstrator, may install the software on up to 5 different PC/Mac's any combination thereof. BUT they must all be under the username you selected for the administrator. If you want different email addresses, you must purchase additional licenses. BE VERY CAREFUL! Office 365, is not for people who are tech savvy, they must be IT professionals to fully administer this. If that isn't you, then buy the Office 2013 Standalone Suites, which can allow for multiple license situations under different users (don't the mistake of patting yourself on the back on this one, you'll regret it). If you want more than my word for it, go right to Microsoft here: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/compare-all-office-365-for-business-plans-FX104051403.aspx Take note that the first row of items is defined as ""Subscription to Office for up to 5 PCs/Macs and 5 Windows tablets/iPads PER USER. Office for iPad includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint."" Can't be much clearer than that, but the answer is yes, they need to all be under the same user.

Uncheck this option if you do not plan on burning anything to disc and/or when using the `Create Video_TS folder' option. Disc Name - use this option to create a name for your disc. The name will be visible when played on a computer or from the display interface on supported DVD players. Drive - use this option to select the disc drive that will burn your disc. Burn Speed - use this option to specify the speed at which your disc drive will burn your disc. Tip: Slower burn speeds will typically yield better disc results. If you encounter burning problems, try lowering the burn speed. Speeds can then be raised incrementally with each successful burn. Create Video_TS folder - use this option to create a Video_TS folder on your hard drive in the location specified. A Video_TS folder is the file structure or directory typically burned to DVD discs that contains the DVD movie. *Additional software titled ""Burn Video Folder to Disc"" has been provided in the VHS to DVD 7.0 program folder for burning any Video_TS folders to a DVD disc should you choose to do so at a later time. Temp Folder - use this option to select the temporary folder used during the burning process. The Advanced mode uses the temporary folder to convert your video to disc format. Once burned to disc, the converted video is purged from the temporary folder."

It might matter if you were purchasing the license from off the shelf of a retail store where others might have come into contact with the license and had an opportunity to copy it. But I think the only way you would experience a licensing issue here would be if your computer is already compromised (aka hacked) before installing/running Kaspersky which would not only jeopardize your newly purchased license but just about everything else on your computer as well. The only other way anyone could get your license would be for the hacker or hackers to try and hack Amazons servers. To put it mildly that is much easier said than done and I think volunteering to walk barefoot across hot coals might be a less painful and shorter (in duration) experience than the fines, jail time, and overall penalties associated with trying to hack Amazon or it's servers. On my system I added Kaspersky Pure 3.0 to a clean fresh install of Windows 7, and then ran a full scan with Kaspersky the moment it finished installing and then updating. I would recommend following that procedure to anyone installing any new Antivirus or internet security suite. I hope this helps! Happy computing! Robert"

It has great content, but also contains extraneous information that could have been left out and makes it 10 minutes or so too long.

The video they send is best suited for the Privacy Officer who will be using and editing their materials."

Can the download be backed up on a DVD?,,"Hi Jane, I hope what follows will help in your purchase of this software. I saved it to my hard drive with no problems noted. I am willing to say that you can save or back-up the program to a DVD or other drive that you desire with no problems that I can see. The software is still available to me on Amazon for download with the serial number. I purchased it Oct 2013. I use it for design work for my CNC work that I do and the manufacture uses in their online classes. As far as I can tell this Designer 2D is a full working copy and I actually downloaded a trial copy Designer 19 prior to purchasing Designer 20. Good luck...there are a number of videos on this program and the help function gave me what I needed. I have two monitors so I would watch and follow the videos in learning the program."

This is a great program I have to admit to make a File for a DVD to be Burnt to Disc because I have tried other Programs I know this is the best Lg makes 1 click DVD copy and DvD Copy Pro then I burn the DVD from the File I know that the file this Program makes is right as far as sound and Video goes. Maybe it doesn't burn a DVD with sound but I never tried and I never wanted the program to ever do that for me when I went looking for a program like this because like I said I already Use a great program to Burn DVDs and that is LG DVD Copy Pro and this program makes the file right to be burned but I don't use that feature only the file making part. I know to go out to spend another 80 bucks on a great program that only Burns Dvds kinda sucks unless you already had it like I do it's Called LG Software Innovations 1 click Dvd Copy Pro it's the best burning program you can get I only use HP DVD-R Disks I buy off Amazon but after you have that setup of programs you have got everything you need for life.

yes/no,B00C79J0YE,"Oct 8, 2014",1412751600.0,"Can one edit text in existing PDF""s ?",?,"There are several questions about filling in PDFs and every answer says to convert to word. That works, but the questioners may be asking another, more subtle question: can you create FILLABLE PDFS. The answer is yes. You need to enable non protected fields just like macros. Frankly, this works much better on Adobe even though I love Wondershare, but it can be done if you have some programming skill. This is creating a fillable form with the software, not just a read only PDF document. Some computers and browsers won't accept certain formats for fill ins because a common virus uses ""read only"" files to bypass security, but actually contains executable PE's, drivers or .exes embedded in the fill boxes. It can be tricky to disable execution but allow fill ins! IF THIS QUESTION is asking, can you directly access and edit the existing PDF, the answer is it depends on the security settings when you create the document. You can choose it to be editable when you save. If you are asking the tougher question: can you edit a pdf someone previously created as read only, the answer is it depends on the version they used and your skill. One trick is to use control-c after a select all instead of the mouse, as no-copy code often fails with control c but works with the mouse. Another example: with Google books, you only get a ""hand"" on a document and can't even select the text. BUT, if you take a screen shot, then separate the layers in photoshop, you can even copy and edit those. There is always a way, but some take a LOT of skill."

If your Canon software doesn't run on Win 64 then I wouldn't hold out much hope. File Center is finicky when it comes to which drivers it will work with.

open-ended,B00CH6ATMO,"Feb 10, 2014",1392019200.0,Difference between Lightroom and Photoshop,,"Lightroom compliments the digital camera and gives you the capabilities of a well equipped wet darkroom. For example: * The camera is set for daylight, Lightroom adjusts the image temperature like using ""indoor"" film for fluorescent lights or studio lights. * You shoot creating ""raw"" and ""jpg"" images, jpg goes right to facebook, raw (which has more information) is used to create that frame-able, award winning print. * You adjust a raw print, Lightroom saves the changes (not the whole image) and the original image. This saves a lot of computer space if you have a dozen variations of the same image. * In the old dark room, you used light (time and intensity) to burn and dodge a print to bring out details in the shadows and washed out feaures. In LR you use your mouse or finger (touch screen). Ditto for tones like sepia and solarization. LR can do pixilation. Try that with an enlarger. * Like the old negative file system. LR stores your `raw' or jpg images in a system of your choice. You can create cross reference list such as ""beach photos"" or ""cute D. coriacea faces"" to find your beach or sea turtle pictures without making copies in different directories. It's like use file cards but without the hassle. Changes are not made to the originals (like you can't change a negative) * Of course you can crop, adjust contrast, color, tone, vignette, control convergence, combination print, make contact(proof) sheets, and most of the wet darkroom techniques. Of course with the full-blown Photoshop you can do all this, but LR is for the photographer and is easier on the wallet. I recommend that you take a LR class from a professional photographer. It will be worth every penny. Also check out some of the articles in Outdoor Photographer http://www.outdoorphotographer.com and in particular the article on how to use lightroom (http://www.outdoorphotographer.com/how-to/photoshop-and-other-software/use-lightroom-like-a-darkroom.html) like a darkroom."
yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,"Jul 16, 2014",1405494000.0,Do I need a the Creative Cloud subscription of $10/month to use this?,N,"The quick answer is no, you do not need the subscription. LightRoom can be a stand alone software that doesn't require the subscription. The $10 subscription is called the photographers bundle and includes Photoshop as well as Lightroom for those that want to do more with their images than LR can like making composites. The subscription also allows for the periodoc updates that occur with software to continually keep everything up to date. It's a good deal if you want PS as well as LR but don't need or want the other programs that are in the creative suite. The creative suite is the only other way to get PS now(it's no longer sold as a stand alone option) and is $50/month or more. With all that info, Adobe has a version of LR that is available for tablets(iPads right now) but that does need to be associated with the subscription."
yes/no,B00CH6ATMO,"Mar 7, 2014",1394179200.0,Is this software complicated to use? I have never used actual photo editing software before,?,"I know the lay out a little bit already after learning some of the Photoshop Elements layout. I haven't found it too complicated and here is the reason. I watched about 20 hrs. of Tutorials on You Tube and adobe TV. Anthony Morganti, Tim Grey, Robert Rodriquez Jr. (make sure it's Jr.) and others I can't remember the name of right this minute. There is a lady on Adobe TV (free too) that goes through the whole program, one thing at a time. B & H puts free tutorials on You Tube to promote sales. I just sat and watched them ""develop"" their pictures and enjoyed it. After awhile I became familiar with the program tools for developing and can do quite a bit with it just from watching other people work. It's a great program. Photoshop will do a lot of stuff that Lightroom won't do and Lightroom does a really good job bringing out the best in your photo's. I would say you probably are going to need both programs eventually. If you shop around you can find Lightroom for around a hundred and Elements for a little less. Both compliment each other nicely. Lightroom was the most important for me and it's not a pixel editor so it is non-destructive to the images. Photoshop Elements will allow you to play with the photo's, copy and past thing form one picture into another, edit badly damaged photo's and a whole lot of stuff. Lightroom allows color manipulation, sharpening, all kinds of enhancements to you pictures. I think it was pretty easy to learn the way I did it. Just watching videos until I understood the basics, then playing with it, then going back and watching specific tutorials on certain things when I need to."

I hadn't heard that Adobe wasn't making them anymore. I have heard that companies want to go to Download only. I kind of like to have the DVD in my hand and if I'm not downloading something I'm not getting stuff I don't want, so far anyway. I just looked up Lightroom 5 on Amazon and I see there are DVD's available for around $110.00. I really like the program.

Any opinion on Panasonic's PHOTOFunSTUDIO &amp; SilkyPix software vs this?,,Lightroom is powerful software that a professional can use yet easy enough for a novice to master the fundamentals. It is a stripped down version of Adobe Photoshop. How much do you shoot? Do you shoot in RAW? If you shoot a lot- the workflow can help you cut time out of post-processing. If you shoot in RAW- it is a must. Best advice is to go to Adobe's Lightroom tutorial section- if you like what the software can do- you should buy it.

open-ended,B00CHZG1FE,"Sep 3, 2014",1409727600.0,So is this not a full version?? What exactly can I do with this version of fl studio??,,"Well, it is a full version but has limitations because its the lowest (or cheapest) version you can buy. Many of the plugins that you get with it are only demos to try out. Then if you find a demo you like, you can buy it from the Image Line FL studio website. What I have mostly been doing with this version is going online and looking for loops, pads, side chains, and riffs, and putting them together to make songs. There are limitations with this version, like not being able to drag loops from your library on to the Playlist for instance. The producer edition has no limitations to my knowledge. Well anyways, what I would recommend you do is get this version if you wanna make music but don't know where to start, learn it; then upgrade it to producer edition online on the Image-line Fl Studio Website. You'll save $20-$40. Good Luck and have fun (^_^)"

Producer edition lets you record audio into the program, just make sure your sound card and computer will work with Asio4All drivers. Long story short, it's not the best for recording in my opinion, at least it's never worked for me."

It would depend on what you are looking to do. If you have an acoustic drum set and you just want to record to wav. file you would be fine just using audacity to do that. If you have a digital drum kit that can output midi data then you can connect it to your computer via an adapter, if it doesn't have a built in USB port to device. The one thing I cannot tell you is how to get fl studio set up to read the midi data as separate channels for your different pieces of your kit. Hope this gives you an idea of what to look at. You might have to youtube and see if anyone shows a how-to on setup for drum kits. Keep in mind too that if you do use midi data you will not get the same sound as your kit unless you buy high quality samples or a vst that matches your kit."

open-ended,B00CS74YQO,"Jan 10, 2014",1389340800.0,What if I already am subscribed through Adobe and wish to go through Amazon instead? Is the customer account data stored by Amazon or Adobe?,,"I just went through this. You can't purchase a subscription from Amazon using the same account your existing Adobe Creative Cloud Subscription is on if it is active. You must purchase a subscription from Amazon using either a new adobe account or a an existing second account that has no creative cloud subscription associated to it. Then contact Adobe and they will cancel your existing subscription. I used chat support, I can't understand phone support at all. There is a caveat here and that is they ask for a 24 character redemption code, the ones that are on the cards you can purchase at resellers. The problem is, Amazon is not using these type of cards so there is no redemption code because you link directly to your account on Adobe through Amazon, it's done behind the scenes. What they had me do was login to my new account and confirm I can see the download buttons and paste in chat my receipt with activation date. Then they canceled my other account without a penalty fee. They will NOT cancel the account first without charging a fee, I would of preferred to have my existing account just switched over to Amazon but they refuse to do this so I now have two accounts. The reason I did this was because I do not trust Adobe any longer with my financial information or credit cards etc... I do use the software quite a bit and it is worth it to me to have access to this subscription I just trust Amazon more than Adobe. You have to have an Adobe account to purchase this, if you don't have one they force you to create one before being allowed to purchase. Contact information is at Adobe but Amazon would be the one that charges your card. With the break in at Adobe I would change my password often and make it something pretty long."

I think you may be asking if you need to be connected to the internet to use the applications. Creative Cloud is similar to Microsoft 365, in that the desktop applications are installed locally and can be run without an internet connection."
yes/no,B00CS74YQO,"Jan 28, 2015",1422432000.0,is this a single license,?,"This is a subscription license for the entire Adobe Creative suite that is paid/renewed monthly. You may install any of the software on two machines, PC and/or Mac and use the software simultaneously (e.g. Photoshop open on two machines at the same time). You may transfer licenses by revoking the license from another machine through the utility if you need to transfer the license to another (3rd) computer."
open-ended,B00CS74YQO,"Sep 17, 2014",1410937200.0,Is the one month plan a one-off paymet with no subsequent commitments or charges?,,"This is an annual contract paid monthly instead of all at once, if you cancel at anytime before the cotnract is ended then you pay 50% of the remaining years balance. The benefit is that you get access to 90% of Adobe's products, more than the master collection they used to sell and the software is updated with bug fixes, new features on a regular basis. The total price is around $600 give or take a year but you pay monthly instead of all at once. If you do not use the adobe software you want very often then this is a waste of money, if you only use one or two software every few months then I would not go with this program. There are lesser programs by Adobe that only give access to photoshop and a few other common software on a piece by piece monthly rate. I use the software quite a lot as a professional web designer and developer so it is more than worth it for me to pay for this program. If you are a hobbyist that only uses one or two software every so often then I would look at a competitor to see if their software can do what you need where you only pay once. You can still get individual CS6 products for a one time fee at various online and offline retailers. The price for just one software is almost the price of an annual adobe creative cloud membership though but you only have to pay it once. You do NOT get access to updates or new features going that route. You do have access to all versions of the available software in the creative cloud membership going back to CS6 so if you don't like certain 'improvements' you can always role back to an earlier version. I personally like the creative cloud membership but I use the software quite a lot. The updates are worth the price for me, they have been happening product to product on a monthly basis sometimes 2 or 3 times a month a fix gets released or new features added that save me time. You do NOT have to update if you do not want to and you get to select what software gets installed. You can install software on any number of computers, there is no limit to installations, BUT... you can only have two activated at any time. Just logout of creative cloud desktop app on any of the two activated computers and then login to the device you want to use creative cloud with and your good to go. NO need to uninstall or reinstall to deactivate, just login and and out as needed."

open-ended,B00CSJFX08,"Jun 7, 2014",1402124400.0,What is the difference between this and Poser 10? Obviously this is better (judging by the price difference) but does it just include more content?,,"The features are explained on the Smith Micro web site (http://poser.smithmicro.com/comparison.html), but I found the Poser 10/2014 Pro training video by Infinite Skills to be much more helpful. It explains that Poser 10 version is best suited for those who want to use existing materials; the pro is best for those who want to create their own content. In essence, the difference is that Poser 2014 has additional simulation algorithms for sophistocated special effects. It includes a 2nd set of tools for adjusting the face and for adjusting clothes and so on. That's it; the difference is not content or what the program can do overall. So for example as a Poser 10 user I would not be able to custom tailor clothing to a new figure as easily as I could in the Fitting Room in Poser 2014, but I can put clothes on a figure, resize it, fix the poke through, and fine tune the folds if I cared to. In my opinion, both software are powerful, the differences are subtle, and the learning curve is steep. And, my recommendation is to start with Poser 10 and get extensive training and experience on this version. And, when you feel that you would like to have a second set of tools to adjust clothing and to add a layer of additional control dials and adjustments, then upgrade to the Pro version."

I think Lr and Ps are fancier and harder to learn, but better designed and handle metadata in a way compatible with other imaging handling applications. So they are more worth learning at the beginning, or you will find yourself, like me, tweaking all your PSE photo metadata when you decide you need that compatibility. As to the monthly payment business, I am getting by with the permanent, non-web version of Lr. (Note that this permanent version does support the much better photo publishing plug-ins as opposed to PSE's share facility which runs through another website, often doesn't work (for me) and doesn't readily support synchronization with the publishing website (e.g. Flickr) of comments from Flickr and photo updates from Lr. Lr is also willing to use my PSE photo editor so I can put off buying the full-up Photoshop editor. For my needs, that is presently quite sufficient and I don't foresee a compatibility blind alley, though I suppose I may be mistaken."

I do have elements 11 find it hard to use. would I be better to go with the monthly lr and Ps.??,?,"Just my opinion.. I think Lr and Ps are fancier and harder to learn, but better designed and handle metadata in a way compatible with other imaging handling applications. So they are more worth learning at the beginning, or you will find yourself, like me, tweaking all your PSE photo metadata when you decide you need that compatibility. As to the monthly payment business, I am getting by with the permanent, non-web version of Lr. (Note that this permanent version does support the much better photo publishing plug-ins as opposed to PSE's share facility which runs through another website, often doesn't work (for me) and doesn't readily support synchronization with the publishing website (e.g. Flickr) of comments from Flickr and photo updates from Lr. Lr is also willing to use my PSE photo editor so I can put off buying the full-up Photoshop editor. For my needs, that is presently quite sufficient and I don't foresee a compatibility blind alley, though I suppose I may be mistaken."

My system has only 2 cores and I'm running Win 8.1--it works fine. I looked it up for you and Vista is supported. The program will be stronger on your system than it is on mine.

open-ended,B00DTNJCB8,"Jan 27, 2014",1390809600.0,Will this program allow me to adjust kerning and spacing between lines? How much can the type be manipulated?,,"This is what is on the help index. Have not used it myself... ""Kerning is normally applied where two large, adjacent characters look over- or under-spaced due to the shape of the characters, and is used to reduce or increase the space between the pair of characters. For example, the letters 'A' and 'V' look over-spaced when placed adjacent to each other. Kerning solves this problem by bringing the two letters closer together. To adjust kerning between a letter pair: Using the Pointer Tool, click between the two characters for an insertion point. To increase space (positive kerning), press Alt+Right key. To decrease space (negative kerning), press Alt+Left key. - or - Choose the Kern submenu from the Format menu (or right-click Text Format&gt;Kern). You'll see a submenu to let you adjust the spacing. Choose Custom to enter a kern value specified as a percentage of the text size. Typically the advantages of kerning are only noticeable on larger text, so the most detailed attention is applied to kerning when creating display text: headlines or text logos. As a rule of thumb, you should apply pair-kerning to text over 16 points. You can turn auto pair-kerning on or off, and change the point size above which it is applied. To set the automatic pair kerning: Right-click the text and choose Text Format&gt;Character (or choose Character from the Format menu), then select Character&gt;Spacing. To turn automatic pair kerning on, check the Auto kerning box. Uncheck to turn it off. To change the minimum point size for automatic pair kerning when it is switched on, click the nudge buttons or enter a new value in the Kern Above box. Auto pair kerning will only have an effect on text which uses a TrueType font containing ""pair kerning"" information."

open-ended,B00DTNJCB8,"Feb 17, 2014",1392624000.0,What Graphic types are supported with this software? jpg? wmf? bmp? Raw Camera Images?,,"Hi Louis, PagePlus X7 does NOT support camera raw images. As with most publishing software, I recommend using a photo editing program in tandem. In my case, along with PagePlus, I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 12, which DOES handle camera raw images. So for instance, to design the header for one of my websites, I'll import an image into PagePlus, play around with it, add text, with shadows and manipulate that until satisfied, select everything and export it as an image (usually jpeg) and then resize it in Photoshop Elements. If dealing with raw images, you would first open it with a photo program such as Elements, save it as a tiff or jpeg, and then import it into PagePlus. Getting back to PagePlus export features, if you are planning to print large documents (such as a 36"" x 54"" poster) you should export as a PDF file of any size and let the poster printing software RIP it to the size you want. This is what I do at work with Adobe CC. Usually we export as an EPS file, but as I've indicated, PagePlus doesn't export that. It DOES export as a PDF and that works as well. It is always better to let the poster printer RIP a smaller file (say 1/10th size) than to slow things down with a full-sized poster image. Here, from the Serif website, is what PagePlus can handle: What images and other files can I import and export? Import images: JPG, PNG, TIFF, Adobe Photoshop PSD, SVG, SVGZ, EPS, PS, GIF, J2K, JXR, WDP, HDP, ICO, WMF, EMF, SMF, TGA, DWG, DXF, PCD, PCX, PSP, SPP, RAS, SUN. Professional CMYK, RGB and Greyscale color spaces offered where supported by the image format. Transparency supported. ICC colour profiles supported. Import documents: Fully edit PDFs, plus import Microsoft Word DOC and DOCX, TXT, STT, RTF, WPD, WPS, WRI, ODT documents, and PagePlus publications and templates from PagePlus 7 (released in 2000) onwards. Import data: SDB, ODBC data sources such as Access, SQL and many more, and copy data from spreadsheets including Excel. Import media and interactivity: MP3, AIFF, WAV, AVI, MOV, QT, SWF Flash, FLV Flash video, MPG, MP4, FDF form data, HTML, JS, and embed your own files of any format. Also drag and drop images, text, or other data straight onto your page. Export images: JPG, PNG, TIFF, SVG, BMP, GIF, EMF, WMF, SMF. Export selected objects, selected area, entire page or series of pages. Export at any size/resolution, and super-sample for unrivalled quality. Transparency, changes to color depth and embedding ICC color profiles offered where supported by the image format. Save or export documents: PDF, Web-optimized PDF, PDF/X up to X-3 for professional printing, STT, RTF, TXT, UTX, UTF text files, and PagePlus PPP publications and PPX templates (compatible with PagePlus X3 onwards). Digital publishing: PDF, standard EPUB eBooks and .Mobi eBooks for Kindle including covers, ISBN, copyright and other metadata. PDF publishing capabilities include printable documents, size-optimized for online and email, interactive electronic forms, and interactive publications with media. Also copy and paste content to other programs. Hope this helps."

Choosing to work in a large range of resolutions (from 72-1200 DPI) is easily done as is choosing between working in black and white or color.

Anti-virus can be obtained free from Microsoft, but a good firewall has to be purchased. The Microsoft firewall is not very intuitive to those who don't know how to set 'rules' of packet passage. In addition, most of the REALLY dangerous intrusion is not virus but things like inserted software to take control of your laptop ... things like rootkits, remote desktop software, unauthorized tunneling and lurking whenever you log onto the computer. These steal your identity, passwords, and use your CPU power to conduct their own surfing while you surf with what they leave for you to use. They can also store their illegal files on your computer should law enforcement come calling for a pedophile, bank intrusion, corporate secrets or music thieves. I would definitely invest in firewall/malware protection over virus if I couldn't have both. But again, with free Microsoft virus protection, you won't have to have just AVG's internet protection. Others may feel differently, but that's my take on it."

Intuit does not have a ""trial"" of the Premier software, but you could download the QuickBooks Enterprise 2014 Trial, it is important that you do not use your ""live"" data as once the data is converted to QB Enterprise it will not convert back to Premier.

I saved mine just before starting as insurance so I would not loose anything if I did something dumb. I have been a Quicken user for over 20 years and the 2014 version is the first time I have been disappointed. I have a Dell Studio XPS 16 inch because I travel a lot. My old 2011 version worked wonderful with the size of my computer. The 2014 version works and transferred easily; however, I had to purchase a pair of readers to see parts of what is on the computer, while the rest is so large you cannot see it on one screen even by extending the size. If I did not need it for investments, I would go back to old version. If you wonder where the search bar is, its the tiny oval at top right. When entering a check, the transaction description is completely altered. You just have to scroll through volumes of data to find what your looking for and put it in your memory bank in order to find it again. Everything I have had since 1 January 1990 when I moved to Quicken is still there, just a little hard to find sometimes. I hope this helps.

From my understanding the product code is what tells the program how many licenses you have available to use. My question to you is do you really need the additional license? If you are only using a single license, then I would say you would need more, but if you have a multi license, of 3 or 5, do you actually have that many people using QuickBooks at one time?

open-ended,B00E6ONJRM,"Jan 12, 2014",1389513600.0,hello my question is about which is the strongest and full kaspersky antivirus for pc,,"I've always gone with the one with the greatest amount of protection, which at the moment seems to be Kaspersky pure. Not only does it have antivirus, but there's the firewall, it can make you invisible to the casual ""whois"" search, it has virtual keyboard, which protects you against keyloggers, then there's the password manager, which allows you to set secure, completely random passwords, without the need to write them down or remember them (although I do use the printout function from time to time and store THAT is a hidden location- in case Kaspersky crashes), it has a master password itself so that only those who have the master password can use it, PLUS a separate master password for viewing passwords in the manager (and using the feature that automatically enters your login & password- except on secure sites that forbid that- in which case I use the virtual keyboard), and to top it off, it includes the ""to go"" feature via cloud, so you can access the most commonly needed functions from any computer. There's a lot more, but it would take me forever to list it. Basically, after a computer at work was hacked and IT ended up entirely helpless, I was the one who managed to restore things properly, and researched various products (they'd been using Nortoon, and had NOTHING on their server). I decidedd on Kaspersky. It's leaner and meaner than Norton (leaner=uses less RAM). It pretty much has everything someone might want in the way of security, and I tend to be a bit paranoid when it comes to my computer's security. It even helped me track down some cyberbullies who very nearly drove a disabled lady to suicide... In desperation, I was able to track her down. The police found her with a glass of water... and a glass full of pills the was preparing to take. Kaspersky helped save her life."

This is good because if a new unknown Trojan virus could infect your PC, it will try to connect with the owner of this virus to get access to your PC and it's files, in this case a firewall can automatically block this outbound connection unless you allow it manually."

Do not buy this software if you have any remote.idea of trying Intuit's 60 day money back guarantee. Approximately 30 days after purchase, I first had dialog with Amazon customer service. In that I was told I would have to go to Intuit. Since Amazon customer service has always served me well, I took the info and called Intuit. Since that call, I have gone round and.round with them claiming to make the refund process simple. ......I still haven't gotten my refund and don't expect to because of the hassle Intuit has put me through. This software is just the beginning of what Intuit wants to sell you."

I ended up just using the online version for my small company, and kept using my older quickbooks version for my personal accounting. But if you want to know if you are able to segregate personal expenses from business expenses within a single company account to be able to easily distinguish which items were for business and which were for personal, then the answer is yes. It is very easy to create new charter of accounts and personalize as many expense accounts as you need. The only problem with this though is when you print P/L statements and do not want personal expenses, the report will include ALL expenses, business and personal. Hope this helped."

This means that everything on your PC is wiped clean and you need to reinstall all your programs, as well as reintroducing your data (emails, pictures, etc.). An upgrade is something that MS allows ONLY 32 bit to 32 bit or 64 bit to 64 bit. Under this scenario, you would not have to do anything with programs or data - they would all continue as before. Therefore, to change to 64 bit from 32 bit is NOT a simple matter, and requires preplanning. Personally, I feel MS should provide this upgrade path but they do not (even for a fee)."

The Personal Use license is for individuals who are building (and supporting) their own PCs. Neither are transferable once on the PC, but the OEM license allows for transferring the entire PC to different users."" Hope that helps!"

You have to reconnect it to a USB 2.0 port as the BIOS cannot read directly from a 3.0 port. This isn't a big issue as most times you are backing up rather than recovering.

If you only want to clone a hard drive, rather pay for a backup program, you can just get a cloning program. Also, if you ever want to replace one or more files, it is much easier and faster to restore those only from a backup set."

So, if your hard drive goes dead, you just plug in a new one and boot to recovery and off you go. If you get a new PC you can recover just your data to the new PC.

Of course, in time, this version of Acronis may not work with whatever new versions of Windows that will come out.

yes/no,B00EFRMBA6,"Feb 9, 2014",1391932800.0,Can You restore to a different drive with the Acronis True Image 2014 Family Pack?,Y,"Hi James. the answer is definitely yes. I have done it with Acronis many times both with this version and previous ones. How you do it depends on what you are setting out to do e.g replacing a drive in an existing desktop PC, replacing a drive in a laptop or transferring a drive image to a different desktop or laptop. Recently I swapped the 1tb hard drive in my laptop for a 1tb hybrid drive (i.e. one with a small solid state drive that speeds up boot up by storing frequently used programs in the SSD pat of the drive) Acronis worked a treat to do this. In this case I used a usb docking station to plug the new drive in and used the disk migrate tool in Acronis - i.e. running Acronis from within Windows. This then made an exact copy on to the new drive. Once done I swapped them round and presto thanks to Acronis (and Seagate hybrid drive) I now have a laptop that boots up really fast. The ld drive I put into an external enclose and is now used a an external back up drive for the laptop using Acronis for the drive backups! Some procedures need you to create the disk image and save to an external hard drive then create an Acronis boot disk on CD or memory stick and boot from that and run the restore from the external drive as source and new drive as target. It is very flexible in how you can restore or copy one drive to another. In short I can heartily recommence this- I have been using it for several years now and its worth every penny esp when a drive has gone wrong or a software install has messed things up. If you need advice on a particular scenario Id be glad to help. Hope this helps."

It enables you to restore to same PC or laptop from which it was backed up either to the same disk (if the system got corrupted) or to a replacement disk (or SSD) in the case of a failed disk drive replacement or swapping out for a larger disk or SSD. Premium has the added feature of enabling a restore to a different PC i.e,. if you have upgraded the motherboard etc. it will restore then find and install all the needed drivers for the new hardware. It used to be a add-on to the normal version. I has this and used it a couple of times and it worked reasonably well but still needed so me tweaking of drivers. If you don't plan to change hardware then the family pack will work fine. Even if after using family pack and you have hardware failure (motherboard etc) or switch to a new PC the family pack version will work top do a disk restore to the new pc/laptop and Windows will normally download the needed hardware drivers- or you might need a bit of manual tweaking. I did this successfully last year on a replacement laptop and it worked fine using the normal(family pack) version and running Windows in safe mode then updating hardware drivers. Remember though that whatever version you use, if the drive image is to different hardware either new PC/Laptop or different motherboard& processor it will be necessary for Windows to be re-activated as it will detect these changes. Sometimes it will do this without problem - sometimes it will thow up an error message. However in my experience in the latter case i have found Microsoft support very helpful in de-activating the old installation and allowing re-activation on the new hardware. Hope this helps"

Each virtual drive is saved as a file that can be transferred from one hard drive to another just like an document file or a picture file. You can set the size and resize as needed should your initial virtual drive not be big enough. For instance, I'm running my copy of Win 7 Ultimate (32 bit since I don't have/need more than 3-4GBs of RAM to run everything I need in the virtual machine) as my virtual drive. Parallels allows you to completely customize how integrated your virtual machine is with your main OS (Mac OS X). I have it set so that I can access my Mac's drives (internal and external) and swap files all I want, and I can even directly access a word file on my OSX's desktop directly in my virtual machine which is where I've got MS Word. There shouldn't be any need whatsoever to use multiple partitions in the virtual machine since you can just add another virtual drive or repartition your home machine and access it through Parallel's file sharing options."

No, each of you must make your own will, even if you both agree about how your property is to be distributed. There is solid legal reasoning behind this rule. Joint wills are intended to prevent the surviving spouse from changing his or her mind about what to do with the property after the first spouse dies. The practical effect is to tie up the property for years and make it impossible for the surviving spouse to react to changed circumstances. Also, many court battles are fought over whether the surviving spouse can revoke any part of the joint will. That's why joint wills are very uncommon these days. If you want to restrict how your property can be used after your death, or make special provisions for children from a prior marriage, using a trust is usually a better solution; see a lawyer for specifics. You and your spouse can easily create identical wills -- that is, two separate wills in which all the provisions (such as beneficiaries and children's guardians) are the same. If you want to do this, look for the button provided on the Congratulations screen at the end of the will interview."""

First let's address the Corel Paintshop Pro software. If you have loaded any photos into Paintshop, at the bottom of the screen in the ""manage"" menu, you will see a submenu (looks like a two tined fork) called ""share"". You can click on one of your photos, or hold the shift key and click on several photos and an option screen comes up to upload them to Facebook, Flickr, or Google+, select the preferred one and it will upload to it. To send via your email, it's: Compose the email, click on the ""attach"" function (or whatever similar name in the specific email you use) find the photo in Windows usually in the ""Pictures file, click open and it will attach to the message. NOW about the upload ""taking forever"" has little or nothing to do with Corel Paint Shop, or much to do with the email you use. The upload speed/time is determined almost entirely by the speed of your internet connection and little else. So if you have slow internet speed it will take a long time to move megabits of photo data up to your internet provider, or to Facebook, or wherever. In brief: neither Corel PaintShop, nor your email provider, can make a slow internet connect move large amounts of photo zeros and ones upload any faster, since they are not the problem."

How does this compare to Photo Paint 12 ? I hate learning new programs.,,"Wow, that's quite a question! I haven't done a detailed point-by-point comparison between PaintShop Pro and PhotoPaint, but my impression is that they are VERY different. If you're used to PhotoPaint, I think you've got a pretty steep learning curve ahead of you if you have to switch to PaintShop Pro. I've used PhotoPaint for many, many years. The version I have now is X5, which works fine (if slowly) on my Windows XP system. I rarely use PaintShop Pro simply because it is so different than what I'm used to using. If PhotoPaint 12 really doesn't work on Windows 8, that seems like a very bad marketing decision on the part of Corel. Do you have the option of upgrading to the latest version of PhotoPaint, or at least one that DOES work on your system? My bottom line: PhotoPaint and PaintShop Pro are as different as night and day, in my opinion. If I were you and if I were concerned about learning a new program, I'd stick with PhotoPaint if at all possible. Hope this helps."

You need to know what format your environment wants for an avatar, and of course what size. With dpi/publishing, you need to start with the high dpi if you possibly can. If you're using a scanner, set the scan to your target dpi (300 in this case). You can shrink things easily, but expanding things (including raising the dpi) you have to watch out for resulting blurriness. There are adjustments you can then do, but you're better off starting with the high dpi from the get-go. (This is true for all image software, by the way.)"

Use it to perform a number of tasks on your large files, such as removing an object from its original background or copying an extracted image and placing it in a different photo.

open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,"Jul 1, 2014",1404198000.0,What is the benefit of having this software over merely being an ancestry member and having trees online?,,"I don't have this particular version, but I have had Family Tree Maker in the past and I've been an Ancestry member since 2008. There are several benefits to using the software over just having an on-line tree. The first is that except for images you find ON ANCESTRY, chances are that for ANY other image you will first download it to your computer and at some time in the future MAYBE upload it to Ancestry. This allows you to have that in your tree immediately, whether you ever upload it or not. Second, often there is information you don't want to put on-line. It may be personal information (I found two relatives who are registered sex offenders . . .), or it may be information that is insignificant (a single line in an old newspaper mentioning that my grandmother played a piano piece at a music teacher's recital). It might also be information that some hotheaded relative will raise hell about even though it doesn't involve them. Third, you may have LOADS of information and only want to put some of it online. I downloaded the ENTIRE high school yearbooks of two of my aunts and my grandmother. Nobody wants to have to wade through 225 pages PER yearbook, so I put excerpts. (Lest you think that sounds weird . . . I also found two cousins' yearbook and downloaded those, and scanned my high school yearbook, my brother's yearboook, my junior year yearbook, two junior high yearbooks, and some of my law school yearbooks. But I digress ...) Fourth, with pictures of documents, they really aren't much use to most people unless they are transcribed, so they'll be searchable. You might not want spend time transcribing since you can just read the document. Also, these programs generally have more options about print layout, etc. Ancestry has to aim for ""the lowest common denominator"" -- folks who upload a few photos, search for and find a few census records, and move on. Beginners and ""short termers"" aren't going to spend $100 on genealogy software and folks who do are going to learn how to use it. There are also more options for storing, uploading and transferring information. Anyone serious about genealogy quickly learns that each generation of a tree quickly expands ""laterally"" -- first brothers and sisters, then spouses of brothers and sisters, then brothers and sisters of the spouses, then spouses of THOSE brothers and sisters, etc. On Ancestry, if you ""copy"" a person to another tree, it only transfers MINIMAL information. It DOESN'T transfer all the residence entries, the source entries, etc. So if you want to MOVE someone to a new tree or COPY that person to a tree, you have to manually move/copy all the other entries."
open-ended,B00EP7AP7C,"Jul 31, 2014",1406790000.0,Will Ancestry automatically upload my records or does it have to ask for permission before it can do that?,,"You can choose to NOT have automatic syncing, which is what I always do.

(I also disable automatic backups in FTM2014 but perform a manual backup before doing any Sync Now.)"

After that I have no magic advice. Hopefully your printer is appropriately installed to function with your computer. Printing a test page would confirm this. Sometimes it is confusing about Print or Print Now. Also sometimes you must configure your printer to make sure it prints things where they should be and in the proper orientation. There is a configure your printer now button. As I said--I have no magic. Check these things out and if necessary contact Tech Support as suggested on page 34 of your Quick Start Guide.

And does it allow me to use previous cards made with version 23?,,It is compatible and does work with previous versions of printshop. The problem I found with it so far is that it does not allow you to make tables and does not permit you to acquire scanned photos directly. Both were part of previous versions. I find transition from earlier Printshops is much more complicated. The format has changed and has more moving parts which is time consuming. I kept version 23 on my other computer which is much easier to use. I am trying to return 3.5 but have had no response after filling out return form. Bottom line I am not happy with 3.5.

I got tired of doing that and took it back. I just used my printshop 21 and installed it on my windows 8 machine and it works. Altho when you run the printshop 21 installation it actually says it is not compatible and may not run. But I tried it anyway, and it worked. I have an HP laptop that is about 1.5 years old, running windows 8.1, with 16 gig of ram. So it is a fairly up to date machine."

open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,"Sep 1, 2014",1409554800.0,What is the difference between the Internet Security version and the 360 version?,,"It is very frustrating that Norton can't place a comparison column on their website. I found an article on techsoup.org, written by Debbie Landshoff, that is 2 years old but explained the difference between the two. It stated that they both have anti-virus, anti-spam and anti-spyware etc. but that 360 also adds these extras, which you may or may not need: 360 Adds Startup Management, Data Backup, and PC Maintenance 360 has the following capabilities in addition to those in NIS and NAV. Startup Management Norton Startup Manager displays a list of applications that are set to run at startup and allows the user to stop them from running at startup or to delay them until shortly after startup. This helps shorten the amount of time that you have to wait for your computer to be ready for use. Automatic Backup and Web-Based Backup Access Norton can back up all your files, except for system and program files. You can back up to local or network drives (including flash drives), and you can also use Norton's online backup to store your data in the cloud. You can set up one or several backup routines (called backup sets) that specify the files and folders that you want to back up, the backup location, and the backup schedule. The configurable items are: *What kinds of files to back up, for example pictures, music, email, contacts, and office documents. *The locations you are backing up, such as My Documents and specific drives. *The backup destination: Norton online backup in the cloud, internal or external hard drive, flash drive, or network drive. *Whether the backup runs automatically on a weekly or monthly basis, or manually. For weekly or monthly, you can specify the date and time. If you are on a computer that is not running 360, you can download any file backed up to the cloud by logging in to the Norton Online Backup site. Or, you can log in to that account and email a link to the file to someone else. PC Tuneup 360 cleanup tasks include removing outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer or Windows, optimizing the hard drive, and cleaning up the Windows registry."

open-ended,B00EZPXYP4,"Sep 1, 2014",1409554800.0,What is the difference between the Internet Security version and the 360 version?,,"It is very frustrating that Norton can't place a comparison column on their website. I found an article on techsoup.org, written by Debbie Landshoff, that is 2 years old but explained the difference between the two. It stated that they both have anti-virus, anti-spam and anti-spyware etc. but that 360 also adds these extras, which you may or may not need: 360 Adds Startup Management, Data Backup, and PC Maintenance 360 has the following capabilities in addition to those in NIS and NAV. Startup Management Norton Startup Manager displays a list of applications that are set to run at startup and allows the user to stop them from running at startup or to delay them until shortly after startup. This helps shorten the amount of time that you have to wait for your computer to be ready for use. Automatic Backup and Web-Based Backup Access Norton can back up all your files, except for system and program files. You can back up to local or network drives (including flash drives), and you can also use Norton's online backup to store your data in the cloud. You can set up one or several backup routines (called backup sets) that specify the files and folders that you want to back up, the backup location, and the backup schedule. The configurable items are: *What kinds of files to back up, for example pictures, music, email, contacts, and office documents. *The locations you are backing up, such as My Documents and specific drives. *The backup destination: Norton online backup in the cloud, internal or external hard drive, flash drive, or network drive. *Whether the backup runs automatically on a weekly or monthly basis, or manually. For weekly or monthly, you can specify the date and time. If you are on a computer that is not running 360, you can download any file backed up to the cloud by logging in to the Norton Online Backup site. Or, you can log in to that account and email a link to the file to someone else. PC Tuneup 360 cleanup tasks include removing outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer or Windows, optimizing the hard drive, and cleaning up the Windows registry."

If you stick to the fundamentals it is easy enough to master and you are unlikely to run out of power. For example for simply editing a clip to send to YouTube - nothing could be easier. But if you want to you can do a lot of audio manipulation. The reason products like this are intimidating is because they offer so many choices.

You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by someone else if a) you are the first licensed user of the software and b) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement.

You should click the Settings button in the nutrition screen and make sure that the check-box ""Divide nutrient amounts by number of people served"" is checked. Also, you should know that, many times, the user gets confused when they use Cook'n to analyze nutritional values. For example, let's say you have a brownie recipe that serves 10 people and let's say that the number of calories per serving is 150. Sometimes people will change the serving size from 10 to 20 and Cook'n will say that the calories per serving is still 150. Then, people e-mail DVO complaining that the nutrition calculator is not working correctly. The fact is if you change the serving size from 10 to 20, the recipe quantities also increase. The recipe now calls for twice as much butter and twice as much sugar, etc. Since the recipe quantities increased at the same rate as the number of people served, the number of calories per serving actually stays the same!"

You will have to use a scanner and its software to accomplish the task. See: http://mc6help.tripod.com/ImportAssistant.htm I have not found a recipe program that automatically scans and saves recipes.

Because I wanted an actual disc, I ended up buying the package from Amazon (fully expecting a disc to be inside the box). What I received was a very attractive box..very much what you'd expect to see in a retail store. Looked great. When I opened the box, all I found was a SINGLE piece of paper...nothing else. The paper gave me the address of the site I should log onto, a telephone number to call in case there were problems with installation, and a Product Key Code. That was IT. I was pretty pissed off about the whole thing because I could have saved myself the extra steps of online purchase of the box by simply downloading the software in the first place. My anger was over the fact that I wasn't made aware of this upfront, and wasted days waiting for my ""software"" to arrive. That said, I have had no complaints about the product itself. I bought the version that is ""life time"" for the PC you install it on. In fact, I bought it a second time to install on a second PC. They also give you rights to re-install on a second PC in case you install it on a PC that shortly craps out. It's not intended to be installed on 2 PCs intended to run concurrently-- you'd need a second license for that. I've had no problems with the program...am actually happy with it. Just wish I had known I wouldn't be getting a disc. Could have just downloaded it the night I placed my order with Amazon. One thing...and this is awesome...these folks have incredible..and FREE..customer service and tech support. I kept one of their techs on the phone for 3 hours one night going over what I thought was a problem. Turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part (not a problem with the program). This guy was friendly, and hung in there all the way through. A real trooper and a kind soul. I don't know if a version is available that actually comes with a disc. Having used the product for about a year, turns out I didn't need the disc anyway---I can always download the program as often as needed from their site and use the code they provided (HANG ON TO THAT CODE). I am VERY happy with this product. Switched to it from the Norton stuff I had used for the past 8 years. I really like this product, and hope this information has been helpful. Joe R."

For example, I just now opened Illustrator CS5 files which I saved in eps and ai format. I cannot say about later versions of Illustrator, Ai and Eps. However I occasionally download files from stock photo companies in victor format and am able to open them in Xara 9. Now if you do a search in Google for AI and eps compatibility you might find comments regarding exporting to AI and EPS. For example on one Xara forum here's what a user said ""If it is just plain vectors with no RGB effects like shadows, transparencies and extreme colour fills it will export to illy no problems. If there is loads of text then it will not be editable at all as each letter will import to Illy as a shape."" This particular quote was for an earlier version of Xara. On the shutterstock forum here is a snippet comment regarding Xara 9 ""I spoke with the Xara support and they told me that their .eps is compatible with Illustrator 8."" Obviously Xara is no Illustrator so I am sure there are features in AI which are not found in Xara. But in my case, when I want to do something quick and don't want to deal with Illustrator (of which I am less skilled) I use Xara. I've been using various versions of xara for over 10 years.

This can be frustrating because you will get a link to click on that will start the download to your computer. Then you will have to select ""Save"" or ""Run"" (or you can do both). The program is saved to your download folder. You will need to click on ""Run"" to begin the installation program. When it is installed, you will need to open the program which will give you an opportunity to update the program (it will not run without updates of the federal program). It will probably take you a half-an-hour to do this. If you are not familiar with downloading and installing programs, I suggest you either get someone to do this for you, or go to Staples, Wal-Mart or Sam's Club and buy a disc and install it yourself. You can do it, just don't be disturbed by the possibility that you might mess up something. That is pretty hard to do, and you can probably download again if somehow the download is interrupted. You know, if you have a simple tax return, I would be inclined to use one of the online free tax programs. Even H&R Block has one you can use online. If this is your first return, then that might meet your needs. I stay mad at H&R because they do not offer returning customers their best price, but make you hunt on the internet, watch for sales or deal with rebates. Not the way I would treat my customers."

Let me explain. DxO is a powerful image editor, true. But the full power of DxO is only available when you process files that come DIRECTLY FROM DIGITAL CAMERAS, and that contain information about lens type, focal length, aperture, etc. that is embedded in the digital files when they are uploaded to your computer. Further functionality is gained when these files are raw files (some capitalize it as ""RAW,"" but this is an error), which have a capacity for capturing a wider dynamic range (from the darkest dark, to the lightest light) in the scene. When the photo is a scanned image, or a jpg received 2nd-hand (say, in an email, or downloaded from Facebook), DxO is limited to standard image adjustments available in most photo-editors. The way it works, is DxO tests hundreds of camera bodies (sensors) and lenses, and creates special profiles that it uses to automatically sharpen and adjust for distortion and aberration in captures taken by everything from iPhones to lens+camera combinations costing in the tens of thousands of dollars. When you upload a file right from the source into your computer, DxO reads the digital metadata (EXIF) data in it, compares it with a profile downloaded from the DxO site, and automatically makes adjustments (further, manual adjustments are possible) based on the profile for your gear. Since there is no way to get this information for a photo taken with, for example, a vintage Leica or Nikon into the computer and DxO, there is no way for DxO to do this kind of magic for you on a vintage camera.

yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,"Nov 26, 2013",1385452800.0,is there a workaround for ibank 5s lack of a classification function,?,"Yes, there are workarounds - although not a clone of Quicken's classification feature, which is what I assume you refer to. Instead of Quicken's class tag, you can use a separate extended category name, e.g. stationery/work-related, to distinguish work-related stationery from other stationery purchases, the solidus or slash representing the start of what would be the classification tag in Quicken. Edit tax-related and other properties as necessary in iBank Manage&gt;Categories. If you are coming to iBank from Quicken, this approach has the advantage of being consistent with how iBank imports classified Quicken transactions from a QIF transfer file. You can also set up in Manage&gt;Categories a group name, e.g. Stationery, and then subsidiary category names under that, including counterparts for the classifications you might have applied in Quicken, e.g. Stationery - personal, Stationery - work-related, Stationery - project-related, etc."

Some minor cleanup was necessary to fix things like foreign currency symbols in which Quicken is not Mac-compliant. It was useful to carefully check my Quicken file to remove spurious transactions, and run Quicken's file rebuild routine, before creating the QIF for import, to repair file corruption for which Quicken for Mac is notorious. Migrating my accounting to iBank has been the easiest and most accurate such process I have experienced. Read the manual topic on import, run through the online tutorial, work through the process carefully, with backup data so you can revert if you make a mistake, and it should be easy for you, too."
yes/no,B00GUXLRCQ,"May 9, 2014",1399618800.0,Can you merge Microsoft Money with iBank?,?,"Presumably you mean, ""Can you export Microsoft Money data for import to iBank?"" According to the iBank user manual, yes, you can. The iBank 5 user manual refers to importing data from Microsoft Money, in part, as follows: ""iBank can import transaction data from the following file formats: QIF (Quicken Interchange Format), OFX (Open Financial Exchange, most commonly used by Microsoft Money), QFX (Quicken File Exchange, also known as Web Connect format), QMTF (Quicken Mac Transfer Format, used by Quicken Essentials), and CSV (Comma-Separated Values, most commonly used with Excel and other spreadsheet programs)."" The best way to proceed is to check your version of Microsoft Money for the file export options it supports, and try out one or more of the available export/import options between Microsoft Money and iBank 5. Always work with backup files when migrating data as important as personal financial accounts. Do not overwrite or delete your original data. Tackle the job when you are wide awake and unlikely to be distracted or interrupted. Check the transferred balances, and account and category names and structure, carefully against your Microsoft Money file. Some minor adjustments and cleanup might be necessary for differences between the source application and iBank, such as chart of account structure and names, and foreign language or currency symbols. This is sometimes the case when transferring data between different applications: complex file exchange data across an entire set of accounts is rarely exactly the same as data native to the originating or destination application. In my experience, iBank has been particularly good at accurately importing data from Quicken in QIF format -- a financial data exchange format which I understand is supported by at least some versions of the discontinued Microsoft Money. Ignore the negative comments and attacks on iBank: the naysayers haven't got a clue. iBank 5 is by far the most capable and reliable full-featured personal finance software which has yet appeared for the Mac OS."

The iBank application is available only with menus, report titles, and user manual in English, but it is easy to enter payee descriptions and memos in Spanish, and to record transactions in local currencies -- exactly as I have done for my recent travels in Spain, Argentina and Chile. It is easy to set up and maintain an iBank file with the home currency set to any currency of Spanish-speaking countries.

Certain Cash Contributions for Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts in the Philippines Can Be Deducted on Your 2013 Tax Return A new law allows you to choose to deduct certain charitable contributions of money on your 2013 tax return instead of your 2014 return. The contributions must have been made after March 25, 2014, and before April 15, 2014, for the relief of victims in the Republic of the Philippines affected by the November 8, 2013, typhoon. Contributions of money include contributions made by cash, check, money order, credit card, charge card, debit card, or via cell phone. The new law was enacted after the 2013 forms, instructions, and publications had already been printed. When preparing your 2013 tax return, you may complete the forms as if these contributions were made on December 31, 2013, instead of in 2014. The contribution must be made to a qualified organization and meet all other requirements for charitable contribution deductions. However, if you made the contribution by phone or text message, a telephone bill showing the name of the donee organization, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution will satisfy the recordkeeping requirement. Therefore, for example, if you made a $10 charitable contribution by text message that was charged to your telephone or wireless account, a bill from your telecommunications company containing this information satisfies the recordkeeping requirement."

There's a lot of info out there about whether or not this applies to home builders, or virtual machine builders (using, for e.g., Parallels), but I can tell you that it installed and runs JUST FINE on my Parallels VM. But in the install process, there's a point where you put in your unique ID code that comes with the OS disc and your system communicates online with Microsoft to ""validate"" your key code. I would imagine that they're registering the MAC address and s/n of your system and that after that, your unique validation code won't work on another system. If you ever bought a computer in the day when they came with the OS on a ""reinstallation"" or back-up disc, and then ever tried to install that OS on another computer (or on Parallels....I tried when I first got Parallels), you'll know that it won't work because the install system sees that it's a DIFFERENT machine. I've heard of people sometimes having that problem after repairs of upgrades to their original machine, and there is a phone # where you can call Microsoft and tell them your story and sometimes they'll give you a validation code for an additional install of your changed original machine that came with an oem OS installed. But that's about it I'm afraid. So figure if you buy the oem version, it's for ONE computer."
open-ended,B00H09BB16,"Mar 7, 2014",1394179200.0,So this is for a new computer build? its the full OS because i just built my new comp.,,"Yes it's for a new computer build. Basically, as I understand it, the installer is windows support. With this version you can't call Microsoft for support. That's the only kicker - but if you're building comps chances are that not contacting Microsoft isn't really a big deal."
yes/no,B00H09BB16,"Jan 25, 2014",1390636800.0,Can I use this to upgrade from Vista-64?,?,This isn't an upgrade its actually a full OS. So in other words you will be completely uninstalling vista and re installing windows 7
yes/no,B00H09BB16,"Feb 6, 2015",1423209600.0,Is this eligible for free windows 10 upgrade?,?,"As of today (2-6-15) it is. But Microsoft has been changing their upgrade path plans as they get closer to release. So by time 10 is out, they may have changed the rules on what will be excepted. As of now it's only Windows 7 and 8."
yes/no,B00H09BB16,"Oct 30, 2014",1414652400.0,Will this wipe my PC clean and make it like it came from the factory?,?,"Yes, if that is what you want it to do. And, no if you do not. You have the chose to, format your HDD, hard disk drive, re-install saving your documents, pictures and downloaded files, provided that you currently have Windows 7 installed on your PC. Or, repair the current OS provided it is Win 7 Home Premium. Also, be aware of what bit OS you have if you are upgrading. i.e. 64 bit or 32 bit. You can not down-grade, go from, say Win 8 to Win 7. You must select to format the HDD if your are going from a 32 bit OS to a 64 bit. It is my opinion that Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Operation System is as good as it gets. Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit is sweet, too."

If you change the motherboard on your present PC you will have to activate by phone. There will be no problem to upgrade to say windows 8. But then you will have the same issue of that OS bound to the motherboard. I have done this many times with upgrades and PC repairs.

Amazon is now STUPIDLY listing things under the same titles even though they ship from different sources. Ships from Amazon is likely to be legit. Ships from ANY MARKETPLACE SOURCE IS LIKELY TO BE COUNTERFEIT, RESOLD, COA (not valid), etc. because AMAZON DOES NOT CARE TO POLICE THEIR OWN MARKETPLACE."

On a different hard drive for the same computer?",,"Yes, I'm sure you can. As I understand it, Microsoft maintains a record of your Windows software associated with your computer, not your hard drive. Your clean install at a later time will require deleting the original install if both drives are present at the time. In a worse case scenario, you might have to call Microsoft customer support if you have a glitch; just explain to them what you are trying to do and they will get you through it."

Installing the OEM on multiple computers will cause the authentication process to fail and you'll have an unlicensed version of windows on 4 of your 5 computers! If you need to install windows 7 pro on more, you need to purchase the retail version of windows, which will allow you to install the same license key onto up to 5 machines."
yes/no,B00H09BOXQ,"Oct 7, 2014",1412665200.0,I'm replacing the 32 bit version. Can I install this without having to reinstall existing files and programs?,?,"Basically, any new operating system installs best on a newly formatted HD. This means your computer's empty. You are not going to save your programs and data. Be aware most programs will need to be reinstalled, then it's data can be restored. This being said, your computer should forget who it was and it's component parts also, part of a OEM disk protocol is to format your HD. Be sure to have access to your computer's manufactures web sit for driver access. Win 7 Pro has a good driver data base but may not have your network card or wireless radio. Having an Ethernet dongle is recommended. This is if you have an OEM OS disk, an update disk is different. Not as clean of a reinstall of the OS, I've heard."

Note that this is not meant to be a format converter - there will be some loss importing in one format and exporting in another.

However, it has pretty good helpfiles, and there are a number of very useful videos on YouTube. Mostly I'm working with building a narration with a music background, for which I use the Acid Music Studio that comes with the package. When I'm done, I will load the narrative-music audio file into Sony video studio and complete the movie. As for a frame grabber, there is a frame grabber that copies a frame from the preview window and allows you to save it. I've never used it, but I'm sure it will work. If I want to grab a frame from the internet, I use the shift Shift Print Screen function in Windows, then paste the frame into Photoshop or other digital editor and crop out all the garbage. That works great. Hope this helps. C.B. Hampton"

yes/no,B00HRQB28Y,"Dec 10, 2014",1418198400.0,Does the software has a feather to make menu and sub-menus. Thank you,N,"Your question uses the word ""feather"", which I am assuming is a typo and you meant to use the word ""feature"". I am not aware of it, however, it probably does, as it has everything else. The problem with Sony Movie studio is that it has all these features but no way to know they exist, let alone use them. Why doesn't Sony Movie Studio access mkv (Matroska) containers? The data within is the same as with mp4 container (H264 codex), but Sony Movie Studio won't access it. Is it because Matoska is open source? As a linear editor, it should. My biggest objection to Sony Movie Studio is their ""Help"" file. The help file is something like 4 versions behind, and they must have hired the guy from Microsoft to write it because it is just chocked full of accurate tidbits of accurate information that are completely useless. I would suggest that Sony hire someone from the teaching biz to write the help file, instead of some software weenie. You can ask a dozen questions like the one you just proffered, but unless I spend hours upon hours hunting and pecking my way thru the myriad of buttons, knobs, dials, sliders, etc. to find out how it actually works (because the Help file doesn't explain anything) my answer will most likely be: who the *&%^ knows? Imagine it this way: you get into an automobile for the first time and you ask me, ""How do I drive to Poughkeepsie?"" and I reply, ""Just turn the key and stay in your lane."" How far do you think you're going to get?"

Pinnacle Studio is entirely usable and the main application is easier to install/get started with but I personally prefer Movie Studio since I was disappointed with the sound-editing functions in Pinnacle. For really simple videos eg. stringing some still photos, title cards, and video snippets together, I found Pinnacle to be a little bit more intuitive.

The download provider did try to correct the problem but after two attempts with no change in the program's ability to acquire the files, I felt I had been patient enough. They company representing the download called and asked for permission to control my computer, so that they might be able to fix the problem. I did not feel comfortable allowing someone that I did not know that kind of access to my computer."

open-ended,B00ICPW2HO,"Jul 6, 2014",1404630000.0,"Hi, I like to know if I could use this software to convert youtube videos using url link into mp3? thanks.",,"You could use an online service such as http://www.clipconverter.cc/ to link, download and convert the you tube video in one simple step. Just copy and paste the link or the URL and the program automatically downloads and converts the file into mp3 for you. There might be some problems for a few videos. For example, some convertors don't allow the download and conversion of large files such as full albums or long songs. You would need to check the specifics of the program to make sure ttha you can download and convert large files. Also you must find a program that converts you tube videos (.flv) to mp3."
yes/no,B00ICPW2HO,"Jun 6, 2014",1402038000.0,Can this product create an MP3 file from a Youtube URL?,?,Left handed response: any file on your computer can be converted. I make MP3 from YouTube by recording from one computer to Audacity on another computer. No quality is lost. I suppose the Sound Recorder can do this. With Stellar I have only converted one format. That was the only reason I got it. Now I have no use for Stellar. Bruce Winning

That's no guarantee, however. I've not been able to get Dragon Dictate v.4 to work satisfactorily with 10.9.4 Mavericks on a late model MacBook Pro Retina with 16GB of RAM. One thing that I did insist on when upgrading through Nuance on was to get in writing from them that I had a 30-day unconditional return privilege. Normally vendors won't give refunds on software. If you can get a trial copy then at least you'll know what you'll get in terms of performance and accuracy with 2GB without having to buy a product.My experience has been that this app is erratic and buggy and, unbelievably they've not updated it to take care of the major problems. A few users claim to get satisfactory results with the Mac version. Not in my case. An option would be to contact OtherWorldComputing (MacSales) to ask what the cost would be to upgrade to 4 or 8 GB and how much of a performance boost could be expected. They provide easy to follow DIY videos and instructions for specific MacBook Pro models on how to insert the memory.

CDGS can save files in .ai , .eps, . pdf and .psd formats. However, with all such conversions there is always a chance that some aspects of your file may not be included if identical features do not exist between applications (e.g. Photo-paint does not have layer styles so no layer styles are included in an exported psd file and vice versa when importing and exporting psd files)."

open-ended,B00JC5Y6WM,"Oct 7, 2014",1412665200.0,How useful are the pdf tools? Will WP Office X7 convert a pdf Image Only file containing text to a WP text file?,,"Yes. The Open PDF function brings up an initial dialog that allows you to choose between converting only the text from the file or also converting the text in images contained in the file.The fidelity of the conversion depends upon image quality and fonts to some extent, but this is true of any scanned image. I have converted downloaded PDF mathematical papers producing legible text with relatively few errors that can often be picked up with the spell checker. In some cases, more difficult formatting may have to be repaired. My only irritation is that the formatting process uses a lot of styles. All and all, the PDF import is a good tool for repurposing text from the original PDF. PDF documents from WP are normally high quality. You have options for the quality ranging from Commerical Printing, PDF/A level A or level B compliance, and Publishing online. These produce different file sizes. Incidentally, WP uses the OEM Omnipage OCR engine to drive its conversion."

Are there enough improvements to warrant upgrading from X6?,,"Whether or not an upgrade is worthwhile depends greatly upon your document requirements. X7 is the first version of WP to allow more than 9 documents to be open at once. I have opened as many as 18 documents without problem. The ebook publisher now does Epub format in addition to mobi. X7 also enhances the ability to publish a WP document to HTML keeping its formatting. X7 also intoruduces new shipping macros that enhance some aspects of the functionality. I personnally like the favourites macro that allows you to easily access frequently used documents from a toolbar menu. All of these features have been stable for me and work quite well. On the whole I like X7 better, but whether or not you need any of the new features enough to upgrade is up to you.."

yes/no,B00JC5Y6WM,"Feb 25, 2015",1424851200.0,Is it as good as Professional version,?,"Sorry, I can't answer that. I have used WP for over 25 years, but only as a fairly lightweight user. I have never used the professional version. I just know that WP is the only word processor I have ever felt comfortable with. As I can convert my documents into MSWord, I don't ever need to learn MSWord. There is one caveat - MSWord can't do right justification, and it can't do parallel columns, something WP does with just a couple of keystrokes. Therefore, some of the things that I want to convert into MSWord won't convert, but it isn't Corel's problem, it is Microsoft's. Of course, the only reason to convert anything to MSWord is to communicate with people who don't know that MSWord will read WP documents and insist on an editable document. For the rest of the world, I just publish to PDF."

In my experience it seems like you will at least get about 4 years out of it, but probably more than that, most newer bluray discs I have seen don't use the newer versions of bluray copy protection anyways. Personally I'm going to upgrade to 14 because after using the trial I found it opens alot faster than 11 and seems to be a smoother experience. Also 11 doesn't work in win 8 media center, I don't blame power dvd though because win 8 wasn't out when I bought it and it worked fine in win 7."

All I have to do to install is pop in the CD, install, and enter my CD key. An internet connection may be required to verify the key but I'm not sure. It's all very easy and I do recommend getting the CD because it makes it that much easier to re-install if you ever change computers or get a new hard drive."

Sage 50 took that feature away and worse. If you don't pay a yearly maintenance fee then you are no longer able to enter new data (90 days after your fee expires it locks you into ""read only mode""). It is perfectly understandable, however, since the accounting software business isn't what it used to be (due to free alternatives like ""Gnucash"" so all of these companies have to change their business models.
